      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The joint sentencing proceeding in these cases did not violate the Eighth Amendment because each defendant received the individualized sentencing determination to which he was entitled. Each presented all of the mitigating evidence he chose to produce. The jury instructions explicitly told the jury to consider each defendant individually. In fact, there were several separate instructions, some that related only to one defendant or only to another defendant. Each ­­ the jury for each defendant then had to complete a specific verdict form, and this jury had already proven its ability to distinguish between these two defendants when it convicted one of some counts in the original guilt phase, of which it acquitted the other. The only way the Kansas Supreme Court gets to an Eighth Amendment error in this case ­­ well, really, there are two points. One, it relied upon possible, and one instance not even, violations or errors of State law to find a prejudice that ­­ that rose to an Eighth Amendment level. And two, it disregarded altogether, with really no explanation, the long­standing foundational principle that juries are presumed to follow their instructions. The two State law errors, arguably, that ­­ the Kansas Supreme Court found, one was the admission of evidence of the sister who made the comment about Reginald may have told me he shot those people. Well, that's not even an error of State law. They said basically that's prejudicial. It might not have come in if they had been tried separately, but in fact, that evidence would be relevant to aggravator number 1, that the defendant killed multiple people. That would have been admissible evidence and that ­­ that just can't be an Eighth Amendment violation."

Oklahoma, a case in which the defendant's other death sentence in a separate case was admitted against the defendant in the sentencing proceeding. That sentence later got reversed, and the Oklahoma court said the jury should not have heard about his other sentence as a matter of State law. That defendant Romano said it is an Eighth Amendment violation, and it's a due process violation. The Court said the Eighth Amendment doesn't have anything to say about what's admissible really. That is State evidentiary rules, that's not an Eighth Amendment issue. And the Court went on to address the due process claim in Romano, applying that very standard. And as we suggest the Court should do here, one of the things it pointed to specifically was jury instructions that said these are the aggravating circumstances you may consider, you may not consider any others. The court said we presume the jury follows its instructions, and nothing in the instructions gave the jury here any way to give effect to that improperly admitted evidence. And that's true here to the extent Reginald Carr argues some of this evidence was really used as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. By statute, Kansas does not allow anything other than statutory aggravating circumstances. In the instructions ­­ No. 5 I think for Reginald, No. 7 for Jonathan ­­ very explicitly and clearly say, here are the four aggravating circumstances the State has alleged. And then the next paragraph, you may not consider anything else as an aggravating circumstance. So in our view, the most the Kansas Supreme Court could come up with is potential violation of State law if, in fact, the evidence which is minimal in the greater scheme of this proceeding that Reginald was a corrupting influence on Jonathan, if that would not have been admitted, that's really all the Kansas Supreme Court is left with to hang its hat on in finding ­­ in saying there is an Eighth Amendment violation here."

The Court has also emphasized the consistency of determinations with respect to facts.

That might be so prejudicial. We have tried to think of other examples. I might suggest something like one is claiming at that point in time some kind of insanity, even though they didn't succeed on that at trial. If there was something really starkly contradictory in their presentations and you were going to get a lot of evidence about one that really had nothing to do at all with the other. But we do believe it's a high standard that would rarely be satisfied, especially given the Court's long­standing presumption that the jury follows its instructions. And that's one thing I would point out here, the complaints that each makes in this Court. First of all, at least one of those complaints really wasn't even made in the Kansas Supreme Court, much less the trial court, and that's the shackling of Reginald and whether that might have prejudiced Jonathan. But they ­­ there was no complaints during the sentencing proceeding. This corrupting influence evidence is relevant only for Jonathan's mitigation case, not with respect to Reginald; can we have a limiting instruction? Reginald has anti­social personality disorder; there was no request for any sort of limiting that that ­­ that's not applicable to Jonathan. Although, of course, the irony there is that Jonathan's own expert all but diagnosed him as anti­social personality. He said out of 26 risk factors that the Department of Justice has recognized for violence and sexual violence, Jonathan has 24 of them. And both brothers talked about family history of mental illness. Both brothers and their experts talked about whether some of these things were hereditary or genetic. This was really a case in which it made very good sense to proceed with a joint proceeding, because the evidence, 99 percent was overlapping, essentially. I mean, they were calling the same witnesses, taking turns with those witnesses. Judicial economy nor fairness, neither one would have been served any better by separating this into two proceedings. And, in fact, I will conclude for now, unless there are further questions, with this observation, that prior to trial, to the guilt phase, the prosecution actually offered to have two juries sit through this proceeding. Jonathan's attorney said he would consider it, and Reginald's attorney rejected it. So the State even tried to ­­ to agree to some workable system and ­­ and it was declined.

That's conceivable. But severance is very, very rare, and joint trials are very common. And very common is the claim on an appeal in any kind of a case that it shouldn't ­­ it should have been severed.

It skewed the weighing process because it transferred Jonathan's culpability back onto Reginald's shoulders. If I may, I'd just like to address a few points raised by my friend from Kansas. He said the instructions solve the problem. Well, none of the instructions told the jury to consider this evidence about the corrupting influence only as to Jonathan. Now, on the contrary, the instructions ­­ Instruction No. 2 told the jury consider the evidence applicable to each defendant. Well, this evidence was equally applicable to Reginald as it was to Jonathan. After all, it was Reginald ­­ Reginald's actions that were at issue. My friends also point to the instruction on statutory aggravators. But that disregards an entire swath of evidence that the jury heard that it could consider against Reginald. This was evidence, anti­mitigation evidence that the jury considered, could have caused them to remove weight from the mitigation side of the scale. And the instructions left the jury completely free to consider this evidence in anti­mitigation. My friends also suggest that I'm here only arguing an error of State law. Well, no less than the Petitioners were in Zant, Stringer, and ­­ and Sanders. Each of those cases recognizes that a skewing of the weighing process has to be based on State law premises. That's why this Court in Zant went so far as to certify a question to the Georgia Supreme Court. Yes, it's true that to understand the effect on the weighing process, you have to look at the State law. But the mere admission of evidence isn't what causes the violation here. It's the admission of the evidence, followed by the fact the jury was required to consider it. And it was required to consider it because it was part and parcel of Jonathan's mitigating evidence. And this Court has said time and again that a defendant has a constitutional right for the jury, not only to consider but to listen to a defendant's mitigating evidence. So by considering this evidence for Jonathan, the jury necessarily considered it against Reginald. After all, if you're told that Reginald had a corrupting influence on Jonathan, you can't separate that as something for Jonathan and something for Reginald. It's equally applicable to both. My friend also suggested that we ­­ we rejected a two­jury solution before trial. Well, we rejected that, not because of it wouldn't work to solve any prejudice in the penalty phase, but because it wouldn't work to solve any prejudice in the guilt phase. And remember, the Kansas Supreme Court found that it was actually error to keep the guilt phase joined, so we were perfectly appropriate in objecting to a two­jury solution at that phase of the trial."

      "speaker": "ALLISTER",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I will try to be brief. The only Eighth Amendment implication that this Court has recognized that really applies to this case is I go back to the Romano case where the Court said the admission of evidence that might or might not be in violation of State law is not an Eighth Amendment concern. The only time the Eighth ­­ Eighth Amendment comes into play is when the evidence is ­­ involves constitutionally protected conduct. An example would be Dawson v. Delaware, where they sought a capital sentence. He was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood in prison. It had nothing to do with an aggregating factor. That was First Amendment­protected activity. The Court said that kind of thing could be an Eighth Amendment problem if you use it against the defendant. Their cases ­­ I could be wrong, but I think all of their cases, Zant, Stringer, the others that they refer to skewing the weighing process, are not about admission of evidence, they are about invalid aggravating factors. So you've basically told the jury there is something else, literally, on the scale, an aggravating factor that later the State says, no, that was ­­ that was not correct, that should not have been there. That's distinguishable from this case. I ­­ I agree completely with Justice Scalia's point, and the dissenting justice made it in the Kansas Supreme Court: If the evidence ­­ the corrupting influence evidence was so prejudicial to Reginald, why did Jonathan also get a death sentence? And I would close by saying that we all agree, I think, that the Constitution values accuracy and fairness. But it also values finality. And each of these individuals received an individualized sentence, presented all the evidence they wanted to. The jury was instructed to consider them individually. And if we were to undo this now, it would be very difficult for Kansas to go back. We'd be talking about having to redo all of the guilt phase evidence. And, again, you get into questions, separate proceedings, traumatizing victims yet again. None of that is necessary, because at the end of the day they got a fundamentally fair proceeding that gave each of them the sentence they deserved and the jury found warranted, both under the facts of this case and the law of Kansas. We would ask that you reverse the Kansas Supreme Court on this point."

    {
      "speaker": "ALLISTER",
      "speech": "Yes. So that's the third question presented in the Petition, which my understanding is that is something the Court could reconsider. It's not denied. The Court granted Questions 1 and 3. The other question that we presented was the only other ground that the Kansas Supreme Court gave for reversal, that's a Confrontation Clause violation in terms of some of the hearsay evidence presented in the sentencing proceedings. So if the Court were to reverse on these, deny on that question, then the Kansas Supreme Court could, in fact, rely on that ground. But our hope would be that the Court would do something different than that if you reverse on these two questions. Unless there are further questions, thank you."
