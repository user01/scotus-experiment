And it ­­ what Congress was most likely saying was, we know that quantifying, monetizing that tangible harm in this context is hard. So if there's a willful violation, we're going to give you a minimum recovery. I think the reason why it makes sense to require Congress to speak clearly, if it is going beyond what this Court has required for tangible harm, is precisely because it is necessary to identify that Congress actually intends to give access to the Federal courts beyond that which would be true under this Court's otherwise applicable jurisdiction ­­ rule. And it didn't do that here because of the willfulness layered on top of all of the statutory violations. And I think also, the fair way of looking at this statute is as a complex of regulations which Congress thought, taken together, would improve accuracy.

And the other point I would make about Defenders of Wildlife is the statute at issue in that case said any person can sue to complain about particular types of Endangered Species Act violations. And the Court said, that's just too broad. Congress can't do that. But it didn't say, therefore, the authorization to sue is a nullity, and we don't have to worry about whether this plaintiff has standing to sue. It analyzed in depth the allegations and the evidence that the particular plaintiffs in Defenders of Wildlife had put forward and said this is insufficient. And then later, in Bennett v. Spear, the Court applied the same Endangered Species Act provision at the behest of a plaintiff who did have standing. So it isn't the case that, if Congress fails to draw exactly the right line, people who would have been within the right line are out of luck. I think the allegations of the complaint are ­­ are the important thing to focus on. With ­­ with respect to the defamation analogy, I'd say Congress, in one sense, is broader than common law, and in another sense it's narrower. It's broader in that the statute certainly sweeps in categories of types of falsehoods ­­ May I finish? ­­ types of falsehoods that wouldn't have been defamation per se at common law. On the other hand, it applies only to Consumer Reports, documents that are intended to be used for concrete, primarily economic purposes. Thank you."

You know, our legal system is people have to have allegations that they're harmed. And I'd urge to the Court to look at the public justice amicus brief on the other side of the case for a whole series of claims in which ­­ that people filed and they were able to make allegations of actual harm. The argument that the Ninth Circuit relied on falsity is a fiction. The first sentence, the overture of its opinion, mentions that there is an allegation of falsity. There is not a word in its standing analysis that refers at all to falsity. It relied on statutory violations, period, including the violations that say nothing about falsity."

The next issue is: Did Congress elevate ­­ did ­­ did Congress say that false statements inflict a certain kind of harm, and therefore, we're going to single them out? And I think, to rely on Congress, Congress actually has to have made that determination. And there is nothing in the statute that says that.
