First, the government's interpretation of the wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule. Second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by allowing the Government to incarcerate petitioners for 57 months for conduct that has never given rise to civil liability in this country. Third, this prosecution contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity in matters of international tax enforcement. Fourth, the Government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this prosecution without disregarding another act of Congress, the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the name specifies, mandatory. And, fifth, under this Court's decisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into relinquishing something that it holds as money or property. A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax claim is neither money nor property."

And one of the points the RJR decision makes is that, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking at the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was, at the same time, becoming concerned that this country had gone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with its tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of cutting back on the degree to which we would assist other countries in tax enforcement.

Certainly, it deters future violations. The sentence was based on the -- an estimate of the intended loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in Canada to determine what the amount was that was owed.

They're inherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or other kinds of commerce. They do not -- they do not assist in resolving disputes between private parties. And often they're imposed -- especially customs duties, are imposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts have said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve only the interest of the -- of the foreign sovereign, and there's a particular -- there's been a particular sensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws, potentially declaring them invalid under the foreign governments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution. And so revenue rules have historically been a categorical exclusion to general principles of comity through which we might otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign judgments. And the rule has come to be so entrenched, and has been so well established, that there's a whole body of background law in the tax treatise of our country, and of many other countries, that is based on our non-recognition and our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws.

The Petitioners arranged, through the wires, to bring alcohol from Maryland up to New York, and then they got it across the border by not answering questions when asked by customs officials and by not going to secondary inspection when they were asked. In order to bring a criminal prosecution that requires specific intent to defraud, the government is not going to be relying on obscure systems. As to the concern about the enforcement of tax systems that the United States may believe are -- is unfair, that is the prerogative of the Executive Branch to determine in deciding whether a prosecution should be brought in a particular case.

Except here restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's taxes, so you have conceded no restitution.

And in that context, the justifications for saying that one country will not enforce another country's revenue laws have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host country. One country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to carry out its own governmental policies, is doing something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and there's no obligation of the United States to assist the foreign government in using its court system to achieve those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it, either.

It gradually came under attack, because what it said is that the United States will not notice that a foreign country's laws have been violated in the formation of a contract, and so the contract will be enforced. Commentators recognized that that was contrary to principles of comity and recognition that each country does have a reciprocal interest in acknowledging each other's laws. In the 20th century, those contract cases completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert its sovereign power inside the United States or inside a foreign country -- the United States, itself, tried it once in Canada -- to collect taxes. And countries said, \"We're not going to do that. We're going to leave it to the treaty process.\" But the rationales that Justice Breyer and Justice Souter have articulated, about complexity of foreign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never been the driving force behind the revenue rule.

On the -- on the issue of the identity of the person bringing the claim, the contract cases, Holman and Boucher, stand for that proposition, and the Peter Buchanan case, which came down in 1950, just before the wire fraud statute was enacted -- this was in the Appellate Court in Ireland -- it says, \"It is not a question whether the plaintiff is a foreign state or the representative of a foreign state or its revenue authority. In every case, the substance of a claim must be scrutinized. And if it then appears that it is really a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign revenue, it must be rejected.\" That's at 1955 And so with the -- with the Mandatory Restitution Act, this clearly is something to collect the debts of a foreign nation. And the sentencing scheme that Justice Ginsburg alluded to earlier, in which the sentences were enhanced based on the intended loss, demonstrate that this is an enforcement action. Stringam versus Dubois, which is an Alberta case from 1992, involving -- the plaintiff there was an executor of a probate estate, and the court said, \"The identity of the plaintiff in the action is not vital if the action indirectly has the effect of enforcing revenue laws of a foreign country.\" That's at 135 A.C. at page 70. And the way the revenue rule has been cited repeatedly is that it -- what it prevents is not just direct enforcement, but direct or indirect enforcement. And so it is -- the fact that there have not been criminal prosecutions, it clearly would have been in derogation of the common law for a -- for England to pass a statute saying it is criminal in England to break the laws of France."

There was no common law practice -- we have -- we have not found, in all the research -- and the Government has not found -- any example of a criminal prosecution -- not just in this country; anywhere in the world -- to -- deriving from the violation of a foreign government's tax. And so --"

The way the Government gets a material misstatement is by a failure to disclose at the Canadian border, which only -- even though they did not put in evidence of what the -- that Canada even had a law requiring disclosure, the only way there could have been any kind of material misstatement would be if Canadian law required it, not if -- not anything that happened in the United States. In Cleveland, the Court was very clear to point out -- one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in interpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud statute is because violations serve as a predicate for RICO actions and for money-laundering violations. And so what the government's position is, is that we should carve out this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud prosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a civil RICO action and even though we're going to have an ad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. But what the Court said in Cleveland is, the way we should do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in the first place, not by -- of the wire fraud statute - - not by having ad-hoc exceptions. And the reference to prosecutorial discretion that there should be faith that the Government will only prosecute, I guess, what the Government regards as exceptional cases is not something that can provide any business involved in an international transaction with any -- with any comfort.
