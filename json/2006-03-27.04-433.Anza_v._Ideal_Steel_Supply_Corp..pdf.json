      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns use of alleged fraud in the underpayment of taxes as the predicate for a treble damages civil RICO action. Respondent Ideal Steel concedes that it was not defrauded, but it, nonetheless, claims lost profits when National failed to pay State sales taxes and thereby offered a lower overall price to consumers. Our position is that Ideal's injury is too indirect as a matter of law under RICO. In reinstating Ideal's RICO claims against errors. First, it substituted a direct targeting test that credited the plaintiff's allegations of intent causation in the Holmes case. And second, the Second Circuit permitted Ideal to satisfy the reliance requirement by invoking the State of New York's reliance on the truth of National's allegedly false tax returns. Both errors transformed civil RICO into a litigation weapon of great destructive force for defendants who will be forced to defend, beyond the pleading stages, damages claims of the most attenuated and indirect character. With respect to our first argument, proximate cause, the court below erred by not applying this Court's test in Holmes and also by failing to take into account the fact that fraud is a statutory violation that -- for which the plaintiff needs to be within the zone of interest. Quite simply, because Ideal was not the defrauded party, it is not within the zone of interest protected by the fraud statute. With respect to the Holmes factors, for three reasons the -- Ideal Steel is unable to plead proximate cause. First, in Holmes, this Court made clear that difficult to prove in terms of ascertaining what the level of damages is. That is particularly true in this causation that allege -- that Ideal alleges as a factual matter."

Because in -- in Holmes, the -- the party that was claiming the -- sort of the ultimate damage was damaged because other people up the line were damaged, the -- the shareholders and then the broker-dealers and so on. There was a kind of a direct line of -- of causation. But the people who were claiming were at the tail end of it. Here, the causation between the -- or the -- or the cause of the harm to -- to the clients on -- on the other side was -- was direct. It was direct competition harm. So we are in a different situation from Holmes. In other words, they -- they weren't -- the -- the plaintiffs in this case were not injured simply because New York lost some money. They were injured in -- in their own right by -- by the competition between them and your client."

      "speaker": "FREDERICK",

They stood in a direct line from the harm that was caused when the brokerage to go down. It was completely foreseeable that customers that owned the shares in those firms would also suffer direct harm."

There was -- there was a victim in -- in the direct line of causation, if you will, between them and -- and the -- and the offending RICO party. Here, there's -- there's nobody in between the two of them."

      "speaker": "FREDERICK",

If -- Ideal is asserting that because the taxes had not been charged and then paid to the State of New York, that National gained a competitive advantage. But I think the Court has been clear that the competitive harms -- and this was true in the Associated General Contracting case in which the Court in Holmes relied directly -- is not going to be sufficient when there are multiple steps in the chain. Here, as a factual matter, Justice Souter, which there was not a tax paid, assert that that person was wrongfully not charged a tax. Under New York law, certificate, it's not appropriate for the vendor in this case to charge the sales tax. And then they have to be able to show that they would have gotten the sale --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
      "speech": "Well, why -- why is that true? Let's assume that they could establish that there was a purpose and an intent to adopt this -- this tax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to undermine and -- and injure the competitor, and they show that this scheme began to work and that their reputation as a lower-cost competitor was -- was well established. Why -- why isn't that enough?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Because this Court rejected a similar theory in section 4 of the Clayton Act context where it held that a specific intent to injure is not sufficient as a pleading matter. The Court in that case held that where an association had a -- an -- a specific intent to harm the unions, that that was not sufficient for invoking section 4 of the Clayton Act. The same analysis applies here because what Ideal is attempting to do is to use artful pleading as through their simple assertions that there are no, in fact, other competitors within a three-State area and They're attempting to evade the normal requirements for proximate cause that look to whether or not the direct injury is suffered by the plaintiff."

      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Well, as the briefs indicate -- and we're somewhat outside the record. As the case comes to this Court, it's on the pleadings. But the footnotes in the brief give a little bit of a flavor of what has happened since then, and there are audit proceedings that the State of New York has commenced. It has not commenced any kind of civil or criminal proceeding against National, nor has it brought a RICO action against National. But there are discussions with the State at the level of the auditors as to whether or not any back tax is owed and, if so, in what amount."

And under Ideal's theory, each of those would be a predicate act for a RICO case, asserting treble damages where one competitor could use the in terrorem effect of a RICO claim simply because of an underpayment of tax notice."

      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "We have to assume that for purposes of this pleading except insofar as it acknowledges whether or not a legal requirement is satisfied, and I think that the cases of this Court and certainly the commentators have been clear the Court does not need to assume a fact for purposes of a legal conclusion. As the -- as the footnotes indicate, that has not been borne out by discovery, and there are, in fact, multiple competitors."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
      "speech": "But do you think it's fair held that every competitor of anybody who cheats on his taxes has a RICO claim? was that if the plaintiff pleads that they were a direct target -- and here, other competitors in the market like Colonial, Alimar, Friedel, and Easton Steel, could plead exactly the same thing that they, in fact, were the direct target. And under the Second Circuit's test, that would be sufficient to override a motion to dismiss and proceed the parties into protracted discovery. And what the Court in Associated General Contracting and in Holmes made clear was that the courts were not designed to be the forums for this kind of long, arduous fact-finding mission in order to determine whether or not indirect injuries should be compensable with treble damages under the RICO statute."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, the way we get to the proximate cause requirement through Holmes is through 1964(c)'s use of by reason of a violation of the same whether it's a 62(a) violation or a 62(c) violation. And in fact, Ideal has not advanced really in order to get a deeper pocket, National, which they would not be able to get under 1962(c). Corporations are not persons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "But 62(a) gets to the reinvestment of the illicit proceeds in a -- in an enterprise, and here you have the opening of the facility right next -- not right next door -- nearby the other facility. And it seems to me all they have to show is that the proceeds used for that were illicitly procured."

      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "They -- that's not their allegation, though, in this sense. The theory that your hypothesis is postulating is a money laundering predicate act, but they don't assert money laundering as the predicate act. They assert fraud. And it's exactly the same conduct, the alleged underpayment of taxes that is fraudulently sent to the State of New York, and through that, an indirect injury. So their theory under (a) and under (c) of section 1962 factually is exactly the same. The only reason that they brought in an (a) claim is, as I pointed out, to defendant. But I would point out here, in further answer York, under the Holmes test, is the proper plaintiff for purposes of vindicating the law's purposes, which after all, is to negate the activity of fraud."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

Of course, here, the State of New York has got to get to that level through a very long series of steps, and it hasn't even approached, you know, the initial steps in terms of even bringing civil claims against National. seemed to rely on an earlier case that is much featured in Respondent's brief, but I don't recall your dealing knowingly hiring undocumented aliens and paying them less than the minimum wage, which gave that person a competitive edge over rivals who -- who paid what the law required?"

There certainly could be an unfair competition claim under State law, perhaps a tortious interference with business advantage. But the purpose of RICO is not to federalize unfair competition law. And this point, we submit is very important because they could not bring a fraud claim under State law. It's not in their complaint, but --"

As a result of that, in -- in dealing with B, the defendant, in fact, can -- can offer -- offer goods for sale to B's customers at a lower price simply because he's getting all this income from the extortion. In that case, wouldn't your analysis be the same as your analysis in this case?"

I can't think of a hypothetical, off the top of my head or after some consideration, of where the violence would have been such that there would have been a less indirect injury than the one in your hypothetical, Justice Souter. But I would not want to foreclose the possibility, as this Court did not foreclose in footnote 20 of the Holmes opinion, that there could be such a case. It's not necessary for us to prevail here because the mail and wire fraud predicate acts are very close to the securities fraud that this Court considered in the Holmes case. I would acknowledge that in the extortion and robbery and other carjacking and violence type acts, there could be congressional policies that would be taken into account. And certainly the legislative history of RICO points to a concern that persons would be using violence in a way that would cause harms. But I don't think the Court needs to go there in order to rule in our favor in this case."

You don't have to worry about apportioning damages among multiple plaintiffs, and there may not be a better plaintiff. So I think if you applied the Holmes factors in this test here and to the example that you gave, the answer is a fairly straightforward one. If I could turn to the second point of proximate cause that we have raised, it's that as a matter of zone of interest standing, because Ideal is not the defrauded party, they fall outside the zone of interests protected by the fraud statutes. It's been well accepted at common law and through this Court's incorporation of common law principles as a means of interpreting the RICO statute, that the predicate act protected. Here, because of the allegations of fraud within the zone of interest that the -- of the fraud provisions. Ideal is not. Ideal falls outside the zone, and under the way that some courts have viewed proximate cause analysis, that would be sufficient. The second large point that I came here to argue today was that reliance was improperly analyzed by the court below. At common law, reliance is a necessary element of fraud. Ideal, for similar reasons to the zone of interest analysis, is not the party that relied on any misrepresentations by my client, National and the Anzas.

It's price competition. They charge less. They lure fraud on the State of New York which makes it easier for them to engage in price competition. So far as the fraud on the State of New York is concerned, its effect on your client's business is indirect. In other words, they can defraud New York without hurting your client. They might simply have pocketed all the money they saved, but the -- the only way that the fraud on New York hurts your client is that it puts them in a better position to engage in the second line of causation that hurts your client and that is direct price competition. If you accept the fact that there are two different lines of causation here, don't we have to say, under the Holmes direct analysis, that so far as the fraud on New York, which is the RICO violation, the consequence is an indirect one, the consequence to your client, but so far as the price competition is concerned, the consequence is a direct one, but price competition isn't a RICO violation, which leaves us saying, so far as the RICO violation is concerned, it's indirect? where."

That's certainly not true in this case. What I believe is true in this case is that but for my client's proactive litigation, this never would have come to the taxing authorities' attention. The taxing authorities are free to bring their own case. In our brief on the merits, in fact, we -- we cited one case where the City of New York suing a different set of defendants over unpaid cigarette taxes. The point I want to make is that let us assume that the State of New York intervened in this case, which is always a possibility -- perhaps it's a bit late now -- or brought its own case. My clients and the State of New York are chasing two different piles of money, two separate measures of damages. In our brief on the merits, we set forth a hypothetical, a $100 cash transaction, to illustrate that. My clients cannot recover the lost taxes that were taken from the State of New York. The State of New York cannot recover the lost profits that my client suffered. So in -- in the Holmes sense, we're not dealing here with an apportionment problem because -- about that problem.

If you don't, you'll have all the problems that were mentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between one person, two persons, 100 people. There is no way to know whether the lower cost of the defrauding person did or did not lead to the shift of sales. There is no way to know, indeed, whether it's a rent, in which case prices didn't fall, or whether it's actually some kind of ability of the competitor -- of the defrauding person to take over the market.

      "speech": "I'd like to return to Justice Souter's hypothetical because I think that the point of price competition fits squarely within the Holmes case. If you were to take the fact of bankruptcy, the mere going bankrupt of the brokers in that case, the -- the effect of that on the customers who are attempting to bootstrap in the securities fraud fits perfectly here because the fraud here against the State of New York enables National allegedly to engage in price competition. But as you pointed out in your hypothetical, price competition is not a RICO violation. And using 1964(c)'s by reason of, the injury has to be by the RICO violation. Simply lowering prices or making their goods more economically affordable does not cause -- is not a RICO violation. The -- the RICO violation, if there is one here, is in the fraudulent underpayment of taxes to the State of New York. does, we acknowledge, make the suggestion about possible third party reliance, but it does not cite any cases, one of which is the decision below, which we argue was wrongly decided. The point that the SG, I think, was making was acknowledging that there are these circumstances, and I would advert to my earlier colloquy with Justice Scalia in which there are limited circumstances in which a third party can invoke the reliance. But that is ordinarily done through a relationship among the parties. The breadth of the Respondent's position here should not go uncommented upon. RICO is not an unfair competition statute. Yet, the answers to the hypotheticals about how many competitors would be able to bring and whether or not they were directly targeted and the cigarette hypothetical all point to the fact that, at bottom, their theory is that any action on the part of a defendant that leads to an indirect ability to engage in price competition would give rise to a RICO claim. And as we point out in our reply brief, there are literally millions -- just on taxes alone, millions -- of submissions by corporations that could accepted by this Court as the predicate for a RICO claim. We submit that the floodgates should not be the difficulties of proving harm and damages are especially present here and that antitrust cases should not be shoehorned under the RICO statute. That is not what Congress intended. Finally, with respect to reliance, this Court in Beck v. Prupis held that civil conspiracy principles should be imported into the understanding of what a civil action under RICO should be permitted. And the common law is well settled that reliance is an element that is appropriate for it to be imported into the mail fraud predicate act here because the damages have to be shown by some type of relationship between the defrauded party and the defendant. If the Court has no further questions."
