      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice. May it please the Court. I think my first task here is to show you that what the Texas Court did was contrary to or an unreasonable application of your previous decision in Penry in this case, and I believe that your decision in Penry or Penry One as we call it in our brief was fairly clear in saying that as to this man, a retarded man like this with a life long history of really gruesome child abuse where virtually his whole case is based on the retardation and the horrible child abuse, that the three questions of the old Texas statutory scheme just don't work or at least they do not work unless you take the first question which asks whether the defendant acted deliberately and give \"deliberately\" a definition. It would have to be a rather unusual definition of deliberately that will tell the jury, contrary to the normal meaning of the word, that you can find that conduct resulting from child -- from retardation maybe even from child abuse, although that's perhaps a stretch, could be a basis for a finding that the defendant did not act deliberately. When you summarized in Grand v Collins the Penry holding, you said and I'm quoting from page 474 of 506 US Reports, you said that \"in Penry it was impossible to give mitigating effect to Penry's evidence by way of answering the special issues. Grand says that without any qualification. I would assume that one qualification is appropriate because Penry does indicate that there is -- that the definition of deliberately was a possibility for --"

In defense's closing argument he said the following, I don't understand how the jury could have misunderstood it. \"Let me try to simplify it. If when you thought about mental retardation and the child abuse you think that this guy deserves a life sentence and not a death sentence, decide life imprisonment is punishment enough then you've got to answer one of those questions no. The judge has not told you which question and you have to give that answer even if you decide the literally correct answer is yes. Not the easiest instruction to follow and the law does funny things sometimes but it is what it says and I've taken all this time with you to make sure you understand what it says.\" That's pretty clear to me."

I don't think that works. The prosecutor did not, neither Mr. Price nor his colleague, they did not say in their closing argument, they did not reinforce what I had said to the jury. They did not differ from it, they did not reinforce it. They chose to remain silent and get whatever benefit they could get out of what I think is an extraordinarily confusing situation. To me the important fact was not the -- not defense counsel's argument, but the jury one might expect would pay somewhat more attention to the piece of paper that they were handed to write their verdict on from the court which was identical 100 percent verbatim identical with the piece of paper they were handed in Penry One and which said in it as part of the instructions as -- or actually as part of the verdict form, there's nothing about mitigating evidence on that piece of paper but there is something that says if you want to answer no, it has to be because there's a reasonable doubt as to I believe it's the facts pertaining or the evidence pertaining to the special issue.

They were supposed to understand from what I submit with all due respect, Justice Scalia, is a very obscure instruction however lucidly explained by a defense lawyer who they did not have to trust that a -- they had to understand that those words that I just read did not mean what they said, and I think that that is not reasonable to ask of a jury."

There are two definitions of deliberately; request for instruction number 11 which is not in the appendix but it's in volume three of the record at 107172 is an attempt, and it's moot whether it would have been successful, to use the jury instruction to cure the Penry problem. We also -- we also proposed several instructions that would -- well I think one that would have given a fourth question, one that would at least have said in plain English nullify, give a false answer, you don't have to tell the truth in response to these questions.

I think the other one we proposed might or might not have. It's moot because we didn't get any of them. If the question is whether we proposed things that would have cured the Penry error, it's very clear the answer is yes.

I see nothing wrong with that. Let me try to talk briefly about my second task, if I can, which is to show that the -- this Peebles psychiatric report was contrary to or an unreasonable application of this Court's decision in Estelle v Smith. Based on the briefs I think that issue is going to boil down to whether the Peebles report was the sort of rebuttal that is permitted under Buchanan against Kentucky. I think it is quite clear that it is not. The Peebles report which is at page 60 of the joint appendix served one function in this case for the prosecution and that was to introduce one sentence which says it is -- \"it is my further professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody that he would be dangerous to other persons\". That is the heart of that -- that statement is summarizes perfectly what the state was trying to prove on its affirmative case of future dangerousness. On that issue the defendant produced no mental status evidence, no psychiatric evidence and there was no occasion for rebuttal. They didn't rebut anything we said. That is, no -- no court below by the way found that it was rebuttal. The theories of the courts below are so weak that as I read my adversary's briefs they do not defend the theories of the courts below. The state does and its allied amici do at some length argue harmless error. I do not see how you can think an error was harmless or the admission of a piece of evidence was harmless when you look at what the prosecution did with that piece of evidence, and that is at page 7 of our brief. This is the last page, the last paragraph of the prosecution's rebuttal summation. This is the climax, this is what he saved to have ringing in the jury's ears when they went out to deliberate. \"He was examined by Doctor Felix Peebles who found that he was sane. He knew the difference between right and wrong and he was competent to stand trial.\" But Doctor Peebles went on and made an additional finding that was really out of the ordinary and I have never seen this in any kind of a report. I'm quoting the prosecutor, closing out. He just added it, he said that \"it is my further professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody that he would be dangerous to other persons\". The question of course comes why -- why did the state love that report so much? They say and they're right the dangerousness was not a tough issue for them, but I think the Curt must remember that the jury wasn't just answering yes or no to the second issue. Under your decision in Penry the jury had to take into account had to weigh the mitigating evidence against the perfectly horrible and very real evidence of man's dangerousness. And I submit to you that it was a very tough and very close case because the --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Isn't the difficulty in this case that what you describe as the structure is in effect an instruction that says you may act irrationally and as against that possibility there were at least two avenues open to the court that would have allowed the jury to do just what Penry One required and to do it in a rational way? One way would have been to add a fourth question and say \"even though you answer yes to one, two and three you also have a responsibility to consider mitigating evidence and if you do so, you may in fact answer this fourth question\" however it might be structured \"in a way that says don't impose the death penalty any way\". A second rational way to do it -- I don't how easy it would have been but I assume it could have been done, would have been with a definition of deliberately and the question the second question I guess, which instructed the jury that a person of some degree of retardation simply does not -- is not capable of the mental process that \"deliberately\" assumes or requires. So what it boils down to is the state had at least two ways in which Penry could rationally have been given consideration, and instead the court decided to do it in an irrational way saying even if all the evidence leads to a yes answer, you can say no any way, and that's to me the nub of the problem here because if as we have repeatedly said the jury is supposed to engage in some kind of a reasoned moral process, this was not a reasoned moral process; it was an irrational process. What's your response to that?"

Second, in Estelle we learned that there was no attempt at all to introduce the mind-set or the psychiatric evidence in that case, and so it was a reasonable application of Estelle for the Court of Criminal Appeals in Texas to rule that Estelle was distinguishable and not clearly applicable to this case. In this case not only are we dealing with a request by defense counsel, we're also dealing with offensive use of psychiatric evidence by defense counsel. You'll note in the record when Dr. Price, their expert witness on mental retardation and child abuse and its effects, he testified that he relied on the Doctor Peebles report.

He has an anti-social personality disorder. He's a psychopath and so therefore it's very important in determining personal culpability and whether he should get death instead of life to be able to demonstrate from the prosecution's point of view this man is not any less culpable because his violent behavior, his future dangerousness is not the result of mental retardation. It's the result of the fact that he's a psychopath and therefore he is not any less culpable than any one else absent such evidence of mitigating circumstances.

Let's take first his challenge to the jury instruction, the first question to ask of course is what principle did this court's Penry jurisprudence clearly establish as opposed to arguably establish when the state courts made their decisions below. I submit that what Penry clearly established is summarized at page 328 of the Penry opinion in which the court said that a defendant is entitled to instructions informing the jury that it can consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence by declining to impose the death penalty. This is how the Penry One holding was characterized in subsequent opinions of this Court including Graham and Sapple and others, and it's true that Penry One discussed some of the ways that Texas might comply with this principle but it did not clearly establish that these additional instructions either had to include a separate special issue or had to expressly tell the jury that it could answer no to a special issue even if the literal answer was yes or that it had to expressly define deliberately. The Court I submit did not attempt to micro manage Texas procedure in any of those ways and in fact as later opinions pointed out it could not have done so without creating a new rule under Teague. Indeed the term after Penry One both Boyd and Sapple made crystal clear that Penry One had left intact the state's freedom to structure and shape the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence."

That was instruction number four and there was no corresponding instruction given in Penry One and so the only question -- so clearly this case is distinguishable from that and clearly the lower courts at least attempted to apply this Court's precedent in Penry One. Whether they did so reasonably is the real question of the day and I think on that point it's significant although not dispositive that of the ten state judges and the four federal judges who address this issue on the merits, not one of them concluded that the instruction was an unreasonable application of Penry One. There was one judge in the Fifth Circuit who concluded that it was incorrect but again under Williams versus Taylor it's not enough that the application be incorrect and especially not less than perfect. And so even if it would have been better to add a fourth special issue, that doesn't make the Texas decision unreasonable especially in light of Boyd and Sapple which say that the states retain their right to structure and shape the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence."

It's under Boyd it is clearly fair gave to look at voir dire and closing arguments and all of that, and so even if it might have been better under -- even if it might have been better to tell the jury more clearly that it could answer a special interrogatory no when it thought the answer was yes, that also doesn't make the instruction unreasonable and as we've discussed especially in light of the other circumstances of the trial. I also think that there's no arguable problem in this case under Roberts because the problem in Roberts of course which was a plurality opinion was that there was no instruction at all that even authorized the jury to find a lesser included offense if it wanted to give a life sentence instead of a death sentence."

The other thing more philosophically, as a prosecutor, someone on that side, if this court were to say nullification instructions are okay, might that come back to haunt you some day in other cases, indeed to bite you if you see what I'm driving at? I want to get your reaction to that as a prosecutor."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHAERR",
      "speech": "I think the way the word nullification was used by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, it was simply that the jury could in essence nullify what it might otherwise consider to be the correct answer to one of those three special interrogatories. I don't think they were saying that nullification instructions as a general matter are proper or anything like that but as used here that's what nullification means. I don't think there's any magic."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The word nullification instruction is almost an oxymoron, isn't it, because you think of nullification jury as refusing to follow an instruction rather than following one."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHAERR",
      "speech": "Right and that was the situation in Roberts, but that's not the situation here. At the end of the day the instruction at issue here was reasonable in my view, if for no other reason that it gave the jury at least one clear path to a life sentence based on the petitioner's mitigating evidence and that is all that this court's decisions clearly required. Now finally I think it's important to remember as the Court considers the statute here that Edpa was designed to curb what Congress saw as an enormous and undue federal burden on the state's criminal justice system.

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "speech": "Thank you. Let me -- I'm going to try to use that time just to try to convey some information on some points that may be of interest. On the question of what a Texas court could have done my Texas colleague advises me that there was a case called McPherson in which a Texas court before the statute was amended did give a fourth special issue and that that was ultimately upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. That had not occurred at the time of our trial but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did approve it. There was an escape hatch available and it was used. I do not have the citation to the McPherson case here; if there's an appropriate way to provide it we'll certainly do that. Secondly on the question of -- I learned to say voir dire when I was in Texas and I'm trying to unlearn it, but it's one or the other voir dire or voir dire. I suggest that it is perilous to rely on voir dire of all things to undo or to cure a problem with an instruction. Mr. Taylor is quite right, that this process in Texas goes on for weeks and weeks and a lot of things get said. If you'll look at volume 22 page 1792 of the record, you will see one of the jurors, one of the jurors who actually sat being instructed by the prosecutors, you should not automatically answer these questions a certain way to achieve a punishment, you should not answer one of them no because I want him to get a life sentence. Possibly technically correct but surely in the context of what these jurors were supposed to do, likely to confuse, my point simply a lot of things get said in voir dire over a long time and it would be a mistake to say that that cured what I think is a hopelessly confusing instruction. On the Peebles Report where Mr. Taylor made the argument that what they were really trying to show was that Penry was a psychopath, I have a very short response. The Peebles Report doesn't say that. There's nothing in the Peebles Report that says he's a psychopath. Sure they said it; everybody else said it. Peebles said pretty much what our expert said, he said he has mental retardation and anti-social conduct, but anti-social personality disorder, you won't find that in the Peebles Report. Unless there are further questions I'll submit."
