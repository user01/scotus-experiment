This may be most clear now in Subsection 2252(b)(1), where you can see that a prior Federal conviction for sex trafficking of anyone, which is a violation of Section 1591, the corresponding State analogue, is textually limited to sex trafficking of children.

But that's because there's an important textual difference between Section 2251(e) and the statute we're talking about. So if you go back to Section 2252(b)(2), you'll see an important textual point here, which is the word \"or.\" This may be easier to follow if you actually look at the statute if you don't have it open in the statutory appendix to the blue brief at pages ­­ at page 10A. You'll see that the list is written as aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of sexual ­­ I'm sorry, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward or a bunch of other offenses.

The redundancy here was meant to go very broadly, to pick up, not the Federal predicates, but any terms or crimes that the States might create. So we cited this in the yellow brief in reply. You'll see that the States call sexual abuse a variety of different things, including aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, sexual abuse of a minor, abusive sexual misconduct. So Congress is using these redundant terms as it sometimes does to emphasize inclusiveness. Whatever the label is, Congress wanted to protect children by picking those up. But it limited. It limited the reach of the terms by setting a bright line floor. And that floor was at children. The statute, after all, its principal purpose as its title, as the title of Chapter 110 suggests, is about protecting against sexual exploitation and other abuse of children."

But it's possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words, might include things that are not sexual abuse themselves. Let's say indecent exposure or something like that. And if you understand the provisions in that way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all of them.

So the difference between the two for adults is the nature of the force requiring a person to perform a sexual act. A threat of violence, et cetera. That's one. Right?

So even though it may be true that Congress could have covered everything it wanted to cover in the State law crimes by just saying \"sexual abuse,\" it would have opened itself up to arguments if it had just said all of those Federal crimes and then any State law relating to sexual abuse, that those other types of sexual abuse under State law were not covered. Especially with respect to the third category, sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, Congress made clear when it included that third category that it was picking up State law offenses where a person is deemed incapable of consenting to sexual contact or sexual conduct, because of their status as either a minor or a ward. So our interpretation can be explained. There is redundancy, and we're not asking for just an ­­ a straight invocation of the canon against surplusage. Both interpretations contain surplusage.

And the Court has resisted that. And I think this would be not a ­­ not a good case for the Court to go down that path because the ­­ the guidelines range for this particular criminal defendant was 78 to 97 months. His minimum was 120. It's not actually a huge difference. And under ­­ under current law, the statutory maximum would have been the same, regardless of ­­ of whether this enhancement applied.

We actually might be in a situation where one canon trumps the other. I mean, you have this last­antecedent rule, and it's an important rule. But it gives way when a certain ­­ when there is a certain quality to all the antecedents when they're all parallel and when the last modifier equally sensibly refers to them all, right? And that that's a situation, so that series­qualifier rule is in some sense a rule about when the last­antecedent rule doesn't apply. So I guess I would ask you to comment on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONNELL",
      "speech": "There ­­ I have a couple of different responses. The first one is that the context is the most important thing. And it's not the case that the Court hasn't applied the last­antecedent rule in cases where the statute involves a list of parallel terms. I think the FTC v. Mandel Brothers is the best example of that. There's a list of a purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent or agent, or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or fur. And the Court said it didn't make sense to only apply this to a purchaser who is also dealing in the ­­ in the fur products, and so we're going to apply it only to the last antecedent. The series­qualifier principle, you know, petitioner relies quite heavily on the explanation in ­­ in Justice Scalia's book that goes through all of the canons. And the book even says that the series qualifier principle more so than others is highly dependent on context and can be overcome if something doesn't feel right about the way that it ­­ the statute reads when you apply it. And we think the clearest indication here that it doesn't make sense for the qualifier to apply to all three of the categories is that it ­­ it literally renders categories B and C the same. I'll ­­ I'll point out just one other thing. Justice Breyer, you mentioned during the Petitioner's argument that you noticed that each of the Federal predicates, 2241, 2242, 2243, have a provision that applies to minors and wards. Section 2242 does not."

And at the end of the day, as Justice Kagan pointed out, you can read it reasonably both ways. But we think as a matter of text we actually have the better reading. My colleague from the Solicitor General's office conceded when she was up here that there is no difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct. So the parties agree on that, and yet we draw radically different conclusions. The government says the solution is to just limit the modifier to the second term, but that doesn't eliminate surplusage. It causes the entire modifying phrase, the entire category, abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, to effectively drop out of the statute. Our solution is to say, give the nonredundant portion of the statute involving a minor or ward some meaning. Congress used those words for a reason. And the reason was the problem they were focused on, which is the danger to children. So the way to preserve effect for the ­­ that modifying phrase is to apply it to all three terms, which makes perfect sense. If two of them mean exactly the same thing, why in the world would Congress limit only one to minors and children? They're synonyms. It makes sense ­­"
