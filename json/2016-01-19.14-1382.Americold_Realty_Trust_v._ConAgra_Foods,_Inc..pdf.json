The next thing we need to do is look at Navarro, and Navarro tells us if it's management and customary to control these assets, we look to the trustees. I would tell the Court that the trustees in this case are very identical to the power of the trustees in the Navarro case. If you look at our petition for writ, and the appeal, on the page of the appendix, page 60, that's the amended statement of trust for Americold Realty Trust. In Section 5.1 on page 60, it defines the board of trustees and what their powers are. \"Under this Trust\" ­­ this is a quote ­­ \"the business and affairs of the Trust shall be managed under the direction of the board of trustees, and the board shall have full, exclusive, and absolute power, control, and authority over any and all property of the Trust. The board may take any action as, in its sole judgment and discretion, is necessary or appropriate to conduct the business and affairs of the Trust.\" That is almost identical to the language used to describe the trustees in Navarro. Importantly, in Navarro ­­ this is a quote from Navarro as well ­­ \"The Court has never analogized express trust to business entities for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.\" Navarro realized that they were separate. And Carden realized that it was separate, too. In Carden, this Court specifically held that the real party in interest test that was adopted and used for Navarro was unique because it was the common law's dealings with trustees, which just didn't exist in Carden."

Shall we look at them as well? There's 9,500 of those. And the Court specifically said that is irrelevant. We do not look at the 9,500 beneficiaries of this trust. So the Court didn't have a trust as a party in front of it, but it went ahead and took the next step to say, look, who do we need to look at? Do we need to look at the beneficiary owners, or the trustees? And that same analysis applies here. And it doesn't matter if the Trust is the named party or the trustees.

If you're an artificial legal entity that is not a corporation, that's subject to the rule of Carden.

So if we export the language used in Carden to say you have to go ­­ look at the members because they're who you really look at, well, the closest thing to a member of a trust is going to be the trustees; it's not going to be the beneficiary. Let's look back at common law. When a partnership ­­ before they could sue or be sued in their own name, a partnership always had to have ­­ the members of that partnership had to bring the cause of action. Now let's look at the common law for a trust before a trust could be sued or sue in its own name. In those circumstances, the trustees were in charge of the litigation. It was the trustees that brought that lawsuit. So to the extent that Carden sheds any light on what is a member and what is not a member for the trust, we submit that the most analogous thing is that the trustee is the equivalent to a member for a partnership. The problem with the Tenth Circuit's rule looking at all the beneficiaries, that's going to be a problem that is so unworkable that in certain circumstances you're not even going to be able to tell who is a beneficiary.

      "speaker": "DUGGAN",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's important to understand that there is a very significant distinction between a shareholder of a REIT and a beneficiary of a common law traditional trust. As set forth in the appendix to the petition, page 79, which is the Declaration of Trust for Americold, the actual shareholders have personal property interest in the shares. They do not have any interest in the property of the trust entity, and they have no right to compel any partition, division, dividend, or distribution of the trust property. And that makes them uniquely different than a common law beneficiary who actually has an equitable ownership interest in the trust property. Under common law traditions, the trustee holds the legal title to the asset but only for the benefit of those persons who are named as beneficiaries. And those beneficiaries have equitable rights in the property that's legally nominally in the name of the trustee. Here the shareholder members, as we describe them, only have an interest in the personal property of a certificate of ownership, very much like the limited partners in Carden. In Carden the limited partners didn't have an ownership interest in the assets of the entity. It had a certificate of ownership as a limited partner. In those two instances, Mr. Chief Justice, this limited partner in Carden and the trustee member, or the beneficiary member in this case, are virtually identical. They do two things: They invest money in an artificial entity and receive a certificate of ownership, and they periodically vote on important matters that affect the entity. They are, in most instances, virtually identical. So in my view ­­ and I think this case rests upon defining a clear rule, a clear rule that says when you have an artificial entity, we're going to measure by those persons that I consider to be the beneficial owners. And I'll tell you why that's important: Because that is consonant with the rule announced by this Court in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and Carden. Chapman v. Barney, the doctrinal wall case, those persons that were deemed to be members were the persons that were the stock owners of the joint stock company under New York law. In Great Southern, again a limited partnership case, were those persons that had an economic interest in the entity. And the same rule applied in Carden. If we are to adopt Americold's position in this case and now suggest that the board of trustees that do not have an economic ownership interest in the entity itself controls, we're going to open the floodgates of uncertainty for the under ­­ for the lower courts. And I'll tell you why. The Court has never explicitly addressed a limited liability company, and they're common throughout the United States. Limited liability companies can call their boards of managers boards of trustees. And in certain instances under those uniform laws, both the general partnership law and the LLC law, managers can hold property in trust for the entity just like the trustees in this case can hold property in trust for the entity. At the end of the day, if we're going to now say it's the board of managers that are called trustees that we look to, everyone's going to analogize in the circuits that haven't decided the LLC question: I'm much more like the board of managers in Americold and much different than the limited partners in Carden. And it's going to create uncertainty. Our rule, the bright­line rule, is very clear. When an artificial entity is sued or being ­­ or suing in its own name, we look to the members, which in this case constitutes those persons that own the beneficial interest in the entity, the shareholder members, just like this Court did in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and Carden. And I think it's important to understand in our view Navarro never decided the question: Did in fact a trust constitute an entity and who the members of the entity were? Navarro stands for the limited proposition, as suggested by Justice Ginsburg, that in fact we look to those persons that had a right to sue."

In this case, under Maryland law, the trustees, even if they are the owners of the property in trust for the entity, still have no authority under the statute to bring suit nor do they have the ability to be sued. The entity itself, Americold Realty Trust, has admitted in this Court and in the Tenth Circuit that it is the successor in interest to the corporation that my client's, ConAgra Foods, entered in to a contract with. I had no choice but to sue the entity. When the entity is sued, the doctrinal wall of Chapman v. Barney is in play: Are you a corporation or are you an artificial association? In this case they're an association. We measure by those persons that have an ownership interest in the artificial entity, the shareholder members, not the board of managers."

And they specifically said, if you are an unincorporated association, we're going to look to your place of incorporation and your principal place of business for purposes of diversity jurisdiction in class action lawsuits. But they did not say if ­­ with regard to every other garden variety commercial dispute like the one we have here today, that that rule would apply. And Congress is capable of speaking. They've spoken post Carden in 2005. And they've made it clear that those doctrinal walls of Chapman v. Barney should remain in play as announced by this Court but with the limited exception of class action lawsuits. So if the court took a wrong turn in Carden, Congress has affirmed it only to the extent that it has announced a rule that applies to associations for policy reasons in class action cases."

So applying Carden, what you would say ­­ and Navarro: If you sue the trustees, you look to their citizenship. But if you sue the trust itself, you don't look to the citizenship of the trust; you don't look to the citizenship of the trustees. You go beyond that and look to the citizenship of the members. I mean, that seems odd. Why do you look to the members or the shareholders, or the ­­ or the beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you don't in the identical situation where the law of the State allows you to sue the trustees? I mean, that seems such a sport, such a ­­ a fluke."

And if the general partner happens to be an individual, you measure by his natural citizenship and you measure the entity by virtue of who the members are. And people make tactical reasons every day in the United States about who to sue and who not to sue. In some instances, they may choose to sue the general partner because they want to get into Federal court and they don't want to sue the entity, but they'll take their risks on suing only one of the parties that's liable, or they may sue all of them. But they have to satisfy the rules applicable to each one of those particular parties that may be responsible. I think the other thing that's important here is that the ­­ the argument suggested by the Petitioner is that we look to the control test, a test of those persons that are in control, and this Court has implicitly and expressly rejected that test. Specifically, the Court rejected it in Carden. But more implicitly, if you look at the Chapman v. Barney case, Barney was a plaintiff in the case, brought the suit as president of the New York Stock Company, and he had the absolute right under New York law to control the litigation and bring the claim. But the Court never looked to the control of the litigation by Barney as a reason why it should measure the citizenship of the entity. It looked to all the owner members of the company.

And from that vantage point, common law trust entities have never been recognized as entity status with capacity to sue and be sued as an entity. The trustees who are the legal nominal owners of the assets bring the claim. That's a significant distinction. But just as importantly, the beneficiary shareholders of a REIT have no equitable interest in the assets of the artificial entity because the very Trust declaration itself provides it's merely personal property. They are so much like the limited partners in Carden that it's striking. But just as importantly, I think, back to the point I was making, the Court expressly rejected the control test in Carden and said, quote, \"real persons to controversy test\" and, quote, \"which parties have control over the subject of the litigation\" have never guided our reasoning with regard to who are the citizens of an artificial entity. And in fact they can't point to one single case by this Court where this Court has ignored the citizenship of the beneficial owners of an entity and instead substituted in a board of managers. And indeed, if that were the holding of the Court today, the Court would be reversing itself from hundreds of years of precedent where it ­­ it chose in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and Carden to look to the ownership of the members and the artificial entity. One final point with regard to difficulty in measuring these entities. It was suggested that there might be thousands of members of a REIT. Well, that very well could be true. But there also could be thousands of limited partners in these sophisticated limited partnerships that are being used for real estate transactions.

I mean, it is sort of a trust, but there are important differences. They can sue and be sued. The trust itself can hold the property, and the beneficiaries do not have an equitable interest. And because they don't have an equitable interest, it's more like a private association or, et cetera, in Carden. But, of course, that means that we look to their interest. We look to their property. We're basically having them as part of the necessary parties because they have a property interest, the very people we just said that this is a different kind of organization because they lack an equitable interest in the property."

But the NAREIT brief, the amicus brief points out that nearly 80 percent of all REITs ought to be corporations. And most publicly traded REITs are corporations. And indeed, Maryland REITs can choose the corporate form of incorporation, and they would be measured simply by the principal place of business and their state of incorporation. Just because a few REITs choose to be associations doesn't seem to justify creating uncertainty in the doctrinal wall framework that's been announced by the Court and now have people trying to analogize to a board of managers instead of the owner beneficial members.

And I think the Court can review Newman Green and look at it and say, well, really, are they dispensable parties or not?
