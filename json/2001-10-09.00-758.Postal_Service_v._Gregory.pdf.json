      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For decades Federal employers and the Merit Systems Protection Board have engaged in the common sense practice of considering an employee's prior disciplinary record in deciding what punishment is appropriate for subsequent misconduct. The settled practice has long been to do so, even when a prior disciplinary action is subject to a pending labor grievance, although in that context, the board permits the employee to collaterally attack the prior actions in proceedings before it.

First and most fundamentally, the Civil Service Reform Act limits the Federal circuit's scope of review to whether a legal ruling of the board is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law. So, it's not enough for the Federal circuit to come up with a rule that it thinks is fair or makes more sense. It has to come up with a rule which it thinks is compelled by a provision of law. And the Federal circuit did not cite any provision. Secondly, as a policy matter, the abeyance rule is very problematic.

If, as, and when the prior grievances are overturned so that the MSPB would no longer have those to rely on, then the remedy could be reinstatement with back pay.

Now, the employee can replace her position with -- with temporary workers, but nevertheless, from the employer's standpoint, he's prevented -- the employer is prevented from filling that -- that full-time slot.

And then if the occasional case comes up where it wasn't resolved, the MSPB can just postpone deciding it, I guess, during which time the employee is out of work.

But even assuming this Court were to adopt that interpretation, there are several problems with the Federal circuit's abeyance -- with respondent's abeyance rule. The first is -- is that it frustrates Congress' intent to streamline the administrative appeals process. Congress placed a duty upon the Merit Systems Protection Board to expedite its proceedings to the extent practicable because one of the factors that led to the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978 was the concern that the overly elaborate procedural protections which had developed under the prior Civil Service regime had -- had prevented employers from taking the most effective disciplinary measures because of concerns that things would be subjected to drawn-out appeals.

We think it most certainly is, and this also picks up on a question from Justice O'Connor. 5 U.S.C., section 7701(c)(1)(B), which is copied at page 51 in the appendix to the petition, provides that the decision of the agency shall be sustained -- and that is by the MSPB -- only if the agency's decision is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. That provision calls for de novo review in the MSPB, in which the agency bears the burden of proof to prove -- of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. And it's important to understand that that applies not only to the conduct charged in the particular charge before the MSPB -- here, for example, the conduct charged to have taken place on September 13, 1997 -- but also to aggravating facts to which the agency points in support of its choice of punishment. The MSPB --"

The MSPB has held that whenever the agency comes before the MSPB and relies on aggravating facts, not necessarily the particular charge before the MSPB, but other things, for example, the employee is simply not very good or something like that, that has to be proven as well by -- by a preponderance de novo in the MSPB.

In the situation you posit, namely where there was a past disciplinary action which either was not taken to the board or which became final after it was taken to the board -- in that situation it may well be reasonable to assume that the prior is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. And in fact, if it was taken to the board or to an arbitrator and the arbitration has become final, then one would think that ordinarily it would become collateral estoppel. But that is not --"

The right analogy would be to on-the-record adjudication under section 554 and 556 of the APA, the situation where an agency simply levels charges. If you don't do anything about them, those charges will become final, but if you put the agency to the burden of -- of proof, then you become the defendant in -- in the MSPB. You -- you have the ability to put the Government to the burden of -- of proof. For example, in Jackson v. Veterans Administration, a Federal circuit decision of 1985, the -- the Federal circuit described it as follows: by seeking review, an employee places the agency in the position of a plaintiff who has the burden of proof, who must come forward with evidence to establish the fact of misconduct, and the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the Government."

Veterans Administration, the MSPB in any given case will conduct a -- an inquiry to ensure that the penalty fits the crime, so to speak. It will make sure that the punishment is not disproportional, is not unreasonable, and so on and so forth. In the course of that, it is well established, also under Douglas, the -- the agency may point to aggravating facts. It may, for example, say this is not a good employee or, as in this case, the employee has a prior disciplinary record.

That analysis would be undermined, would be nullified if the Government could simply come in and say, we got this one little charge, and then we have these 19 others.

Respondent's reliance on the Douglas case is a little bit odd because that case was followed by the Bolling case and scores of other precedents which established the framework by which the Merit Systems Protection Board considers prior disciplinary actions, even when they're subject to grievance. The board allows -- it requires the employer to prove the fact of the prior action, and then it -- it allows the employee -- in addition to the fact of the prior action, that certain procedural protections were present. And then it allows the employee an opportunity to collaterally attack that action. That -- that comports with the employer's burden of proof under the statute. It's supported by decades of administrative practice, and the Federal circuit had absolutely no basis for invalidating that practice without citing to any provision of -- of law or anything else.
