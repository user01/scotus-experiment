    "speech": "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company, approved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding leases between the parties. With respect to the lease principally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the amendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody from 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent of the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in the amount of the royalty. That new royalty level was the same as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and it was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that the Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal company could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per ton. The package of lease amendments also contained numerous other provisions that were of benefit to the tribe, including amendments to the other lease, that more -- that approximately doubled the amount of the royalty and a substantial increase in payments for water use at the mines. The Secretary's approval of the lease package in 1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the regulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern her approval of lease agreements under that act. Because there was no violation of any act of Congress or regulation of an executive department, much less one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of action in this case under the Tucker Act. The Court --"

    "speech": "And there's been no application to set aside the lease."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",

    "speech": "And since the events, has the tribe obtained the authority to impose taxes that was not previously --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "It -- well, the -- this Court in 1985 in the Kerr-McGee case upheld the right of the Navajo tribe to impose taxes, but that's without the Secretary's approval. And these lease agreement -- the lease amendments in 1987 were negotiated and arrived at in -- in the context of that decision. Now, the -- the tribe has waived its right to collect taxes with respect to coal that goes to the -- a generating station in -- in Arizona. The rest of the coal, though, is subject to the -- to the tax. There's an overall cap on that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Kneedler, just -- could I just go back for a second to the Secretary's private communications with the -- the coal company? Is it your position that did not breach any fiduciary obligation whatsoever?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "They did not have a fiduciary obligation to the tribes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "It did not -- it did not breach a legal fiduciary obligation. There is a -- there is a sense in which everything that the Secretary of the Interior does or, for that matter, everything the United States Government does with respect to Indians is -- is of a fiduciary nature in a moral sense. In a political sense --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So at least in that respect, it's different from the Vermont Yankee situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, but -- but it's important to look at the context in which this communication occurred. The -- what -- what the -- what the Secretary was being asked to do or -- or what -- what the Interior Department was being asked to do was to make an adjustment under an existing -- a term of the existing lease that said that the royalty amount that was then prescribed, which was 37-and-a-half percent, was subject to a reasonable adjustment by the Secretary after the 20-year anniversary of the lease."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, isn't it -- isn't it -- maybe I misunderstand the facts. But wasn't it fairly clear that had this conversation not taken place, that the adjustment would have been put into effect that the tribe wanted?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "I don't think that's clear at all because the -- Peabody Coal Company -- aside from this communication, Peabody Coal Company sent the letter to the Secretary of the Interior in early July of 1985 in -- in which the representative of Peabody said, it appears that the tribe believes that there's an imminent decision in its favor on appeal from the local BIA area directors setting the 20 percent rate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Which was true, wasn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, yes. That was -- that was true. But that's a subordinate official in the Interior Department. The Secretary of the Interior -- as a matter of constitutional law, and as a matter of the regulations in effect at the time, the Secretary of the Interior had the authority to take control of any matter that was then pending in the Department. But my important -- the important point is that in that letter, Peabody Coal Company requested the Secretary to assume jurisdiction over the matter, and to either rule in its favor or, failing that, to -- to send the parties -- request the parties to negotiate further, which is exactly what happened."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that letter --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "That letter -- that letter was -- a copy of that letter was sent to the Navajo Nation. And it -- it subsequently is clear that -- deposition testimony of Mr. Nelson, which is in the joint appendix in this case, makes it clear that he understood. He was -- he was a special assistant to the chairman of the Navajo Nation at the time. It makes it clear that -- that the Navajo Nation had understood that the Secretary preferred for them to go back to negotiate, which was a -- a perfectly reasonable response by the Secretary of the Interior in that situation. The -- the increase of the royalty rate from -- from approximately 1 percent or a little over 1 percent to 20 percent was unilateral by the area director. It -- there was not a -- input by -- by Peabody at that time, even though the area director communicated with --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did both the tribe and Peabody understand what was being considered, the increase that had been recommended by the junior people in the Department?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes. That -- that -- the -- the area director's increase of -- to 20 percent, an adjustment of 20 percent, was appealed by -- was appealed by Peabody and the utilities that -- that are served by Peabody. And that appeal was briefed to the Assistant Secretary, and it was pending. And then in -- in July that was -- that area director's decision was in 1984. The briefing was, I think, about 6 months later, and then in July of 1985, the -- is -- is when the Secretary requested the Assistant Secretary to put off deciding this and have the parties negotiate. And they reached a tentative agreement within -- within a month. It was --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If -- if Fritz, the Assistant Secretary, had signed off on the 20 percent, would there have been a further -- further recourse by --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "The -- the Secretary could have overruled that. The -- the Secretary under the -- under the governing regulations that we quote in our brief the Secretary retained the authority to overrule any decision by -- by the Assistant Secretary."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. -- I'm sorry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "No. I believe that could have still been subject to the Secretary's determination. What -- what the Navajo Nation could have done, if it did not want to continue with negotiations, was to request that the matter be transferred from this informal appeals process to the Assistant Secretary to a formal appeals process which goes to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I think --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "At that point the Secretary could have assumed jurisdiction of the matter from the IBIA under the same regulation I referred to. The Secretary always had it within his power to -- to take -- take cognizance of a case and not leave it with the -- with the board."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Even if the court --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "There was a prohibition against ex parte contacts in that formal adjudication, but otherwise the Secretary retained the authority to -- to take the case."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, did the -- was the Secretary's approval required on the contract that included, or the -- the revision that included the 12-and-a-half percent royalty rate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, there were two leases, and the Secretary's approval was required. But the reason was different for the two. In the -- under the lease principally at issue here, 8580 --"

    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "As to that, we believe that there could be no claim under the Tucker Act for the -- for the fundamental reason that that is not a -- a duty that is prescribed by an act of Congress, or a regulation under the Tucker Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, no. I -- I understand. Wasn't that also subject to the general statutory requirement that these leases be approved by the Secretary? They -- you know, it would be negotiated by the tribes, but ultimately didn't it require the Secretary's approval?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "It -- it may well have and that was not -- that was not addressed. The basis of the claim here was --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "-- that the Secretary had -- had a duty under the lease."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- let -- let me just assume and -- and maybe I shouldn't do this, but you just briefly at least assume that the Secretary's approval was required as a -- a matter of statute. Would that approval responsibility -- in your judgment -- carry any duty toward the tribe, anything comparable to a fiduciary duty toward the tribe not to approve an amendment if that amendment was not as good as the -- in the Secretary's judgment, the tribe could have gotten?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "No. There's -- in -- in our view there is no duty under this statute to maximize returns to the tribe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What -- Tell -- let me ask you -- maybe it would be easier if I asked you kind of the converse question. What responsibility does the approval responsibility include? In other words, is it merely ministerial, or does it imply any duty at all toward the tribe?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "I don't know that I would call it ministerial, but -- but the statute is -- is rather bare in its terms. It just says that the -- that the tribe, through its council -- and this is -- this is a statute of general application -- may -- with the approval of the Secretary -- lease its land for coal purposes. What the -- what the preconditions for the Secretary to give his approval are then and now is a matter for the Secretary to flesh out by regulations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, is -- does the United States, though, have some general duty of trust to the tribe?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "I think it would be fair to say that -- that there is -- that there is a -- as I said, a general moral and political duty."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Sure. And so when the Secretary has to approve a lease, should that general duty be kept in mind as part of that process?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Surely. Surely, and again we're not -- we're -- we quite agree that as -- that as a matter of what -- what judgment should -- should inform the Secretary in her approval of the lease."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No. But suppose the Government has a general moral and political duty to the entire citizenry not to lease Government land at -- at bandit rates I assume."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes, but I meant --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That doesn't give rise to a cause of action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "That -- that's true. Here there is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Nor -- nor is there any specific statute, is there? I mean, I -- I think the -- the point that Justice O'Connor is -- is raising is -- is my point. Once you get a specific statutory obligation, assuming that approval carries some obligation of care, inquiry, whatever, doesn't that carry with it some of the duty that we normally have in mind when we talk about the trust duty, and doesn't that take it out of the sphere of the merely moral and the merely political into the legal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, that -- let me answer it this way. The Secretary -- as I said, I believe it's up to the Secretary to decide how to flesh out the regime for her approval of leases and she has done this in the regulations including, importantly, now and at the time this lease was -- lease amendments were approved, a minimum royalty amount. At the time, it was just 10 cents per ton. Now, it's 12-and-a-half percent, which is the standard rate of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But a minimum -- a minimum is a minimum."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "No."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So there's still something to argue about there, I would --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, no. And it's important to understand why -- why I -- I think that's not correct the way the Secretary's regulations are written. This act has a number of goals, one of which is revenue for the tribe, but another is tribal self- determination, and this is clear from the legislative history of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act as described in 1938 and described by this Court in its Cotton Petroleum decision. So the -- the point is that it is up to the tribe to enter into agreements subject to approval by the Secretary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, then I -- I think the implication of your argument is that the approval is purely ministerial. In other words, if the tribe is the responsible party, then the Government is not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, the -- the -- it's actually something of a hybrid I -- I believe. And what the Secretary has chosen to impose on herself, which is not the same thing as to whether it's -- it's legally enforceable, is a set of regulations that would govern the way in which she approves a lease. And with respect to -- again, with respect to royalty, there is a specific regulation that says 12-and-a-half percent. What -- the way the Secretary has -- has accommodated these competing goals is that there is a -- a minimum set of standards to which any agreement between a tribe and a lessee enter into, any -- a set of standards that must be satisfied. Beyond that -- beyond those -- satisfaction of those standards, it is up to the tribe and the -- and the lessee --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, all right. That's, I take it, their argument -- as I understand their argument, or part of it anyway, is that if you put -- we hold property in trust for the tribe. That by itself doesn't do much for them. That's Mitchell I."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But when you get a whole lot of very detailed rules and regulations about how the Government needs to behave, well, then, you find that there is a specific duty for the Government even if it isn't quite in those rules and regulations to behave like a trustee of a trust, i.e., use prudent care, reasonable care, whatever the standards are. So they're saying whatever the details of the regs are here, there certainly was a highly detailed set of something that governed how the Government would behave in this particular lease complexity, a very complicated situation. And therefore, regardless of what they said, there was also, because of that complexity, an obligation for the Government to use reasonable, prudent care no matter what the regs said."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that's what they didn't do here. You see, it's just like Mitchell II."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "But it's -- it's not just like Mitchell II."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. Now, what's your response to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "And I -- and I think the important difference is in Mitchell II the Court recited a number of specific statutory duties -- statutory and regulatory duties that were directed at assuring a particular amount of income for the tribe under the circumstances. Fair market value for a right-of-way. Sustained yield management of -- of timber harvest. Specific statutory directives to take into account the financial needs of the beneficiaries whose allotments were going to be logged off."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I see where you're going. I see where you're going with that. But that reads Mitchell II very narrowly. And it is as if in that forest filled with Government foresters that the tribe members had to stay out of, one day a forester working for the Government introduces some termites into the trees, and lo and behold, there doesn't happen to be a particular anti- termite regulation. I think you'd read Mitchell II as even though there's no anti-termite regulation, still there was a duty of care there for the Government not to behave that way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "I -- I -- I don't think so. I mean, again, there may be -- there may be a tort action. The -- the Tucker Act does not cover the entire universe --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If -- if I read Mitchell II somewhat more broadly and thought that there was an obligation there to behave like a trustee even if I couldn't pin it to a particular reg, this particular action, would I then have to decide against you here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, no, because we -- we think that there was -- that the Secretary's approval of the -- of the lease amendments in 1987 satisfied a duty of reasonable prudence. The standard that was articulated in the documents presented to the Secretary for approval was -- was whether the lease package could be regarded as a reasonable exercise of -- of business judgment. This was set forward --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that -- that argument sort of takes the lease terms simply in the context of the -- the 12-and-a-half percent minimum that the Secretary had taken. But it seems to me that they have a stronger argument and it is closer to the termite argument. And the stronger argument is whatever your obligations as a trustee may be under the approval responsibility, you at least have an obligation not to skew the bargaining process in a way that hurts us when you know that is what it will do. And as I understand the argument about the ex parte communication, it's not that the ex parte communication was per se unlawful. It -- it clearly wasn't. The argument is that the ex parte communication resulted in action by the Secretary that, in effect, induced the tribe to take a different negotiating posture from the one it would have taken. And therefore, their argument is like the termite argument: You're not supposed to introduce bad termites into the forest, and you're not supposed to take action as a minimum that hurts us as negotiators. What is your response to that?"

But beyond that, when they -- then the -- this -- this -- these are all things that happened in 1984 and 1985. That was superseded by the parties' lease agreement in 1987. In 1987, as part of the lease agreement that was submitted to the Secretary and that the Navajo Nation requested that the Secretary approve, the area director's decision that initially established a 20 percent rate unilaterally was vacated and Peabody's appeal was dismissed. That wiped the slate clean for everything that happened up until then. The question then is what is -- was the 1987 lease amendment package proper? And under Mitchell, as we see it, unless there is a violation of a specific statutory or regulatory provision in the approval of the lease, there cannot be a claim for money damages under the Tucker Act. And --"

    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes. In -- in 1987, what the parties presented to the Secretary was not a proposal to adjust the royalty under the -- Article VI of the existing lease. It was a set of new amendments that, among other things, superseded that clause of the lease and put in place another dispute resolution mechanism for adjusting the royalties in the future. As part of that, the -- the controversy with respect to the 1985 -- 1984 to 1985 adjustment was -- was eliminated. But that 1987 package provided well in excess of the minimum royalty rate both for the 8580 lease and also the other lease with -- for the Navajo with respect to coal it owned jointly with the Hopi Tribe. And that satisfied the specific regulatory standard that the Secretary had prescribed for deciding when she would approve lease agreements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What I can't quite understand with reference to your position as to the correct reading of Mitchell II is this: It seems to me you say that even if there's a breach of a fiduciary duty, there still has to be some specific statute or regulation which we violate, and that specific statute or regulation must imply that there is a cause of action for damages. That makes the fiduciary component quite irrelevant. Either there's a  specific statute, or there isn't."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "No, I don't think it does because it -- the fiduciary -- the important discussion in Mitchell II of the fiduciary responsibility had to do with whether the specific statutory or regulatory duty -- which is prong one -- could in turn be fairly interpreted to requirement -- require the payment of compensation. That's where the fiduciary obligation comes in. But this case fails at the first step because there is no specific statutory or regulatory provision that was violated. There's no need to get to the second step in the analysis on that theory. And this specificity requirement was reflected in Testan and Sheehan, both of which were decided prior to -- to Mitchell. Both say that there has to be a right granted with specificity. It's also confirmed by things that have happened since then. That's the way the Federal Circuit in the Brown and Pawnee decisions that we -- that were cited in the decision below looked at Mitchell -- Mitchell II. There had to be a specific provision that was violated. And that's also entirely consistent with last year's decision in the Gonzaga case under -- under the very parallel situation of 1983 where the Court said there has to be a -- a right granted with specificity -- an  entitlement granted with specificity -- where the question is whether a -- a -- another Federal statute gives rise to a cause of action under a general cause of action creating a statute, in that case 1983. But we think the analysis is directly parallel. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."

And violations of trust duties, when the Government is exercising responsibilities, within the contours of those statutes and regulations, gives rise to a claim for money damages in the Court of Federal Claims. That's what's missing."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's true, but -- but the Government had a good response to my question, which was that if, in fact, I was agreeing with you for the purposes of interpreting Mitchell II hypothetically, they said, you know, this is a procedure, and it's a procedure that you're complaining was violated. And that's significant for two reasons. First, it would read this trust responsibility as creating procedures in identical circumstances where a party is an Indian tribe that do not exist in respect to anyone else, and secondly, it would be finding a -- money damages, $600 million in fact, for a violation of this -- one of these procedural regulations. And I cannot even think -- though there may be some, I cannot think of an instance where a private person who really has been badly hurt can recover money damages from the Government where what the Government did was not follow the right procedure. So it's new procedures, plus the money damages, and you'd have to overcome all those hurdles."

    "speech": "Volume II of the joint appendix in this Court includes both the original lease and these coal lease amendments, and they're virtually totally different documents. There's new tax waivers. There's a new dedication of 90 million tons of coal. There's a -- for the north lease and for the other lease another 180 million tons of coal, all without a competitive bid. So we not only didn't get the Federal minimum, we certainly didn't get 20 percent. We didn't get the Federal minimum of 12-and-a-half percent, and we had to pay a bonus to the companies of $89 million to get what we got."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you got a severance tax as part of the package, and one of the things that the Government suggested is if -- if you take the 12 percent and you add the 8 percent, then you get up to the 20 percent, which was your figure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, we had the tax before all of this happened. And as -- as my brother Kneedler mentioned to the Court, we can't tax 60 percent of the coal because it goes to the Navajo generating station which has a tax waiver in the plant site lease. So we're capped at the 12-and-a-half percent royalty level for 60 percent of the coal. And before we entered into these lease amendments, we were not restricted in the amount of taxes that the Navajo Nation could impose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And as I understand it now, it's -- what you're saying, it's just as if the trees in Mitchell where the money from the tree was supposed to go to the Indians, if the Government had cut it down and sold it for a half a cent a tree."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. And all this other stuff with the procedures is just evidentiary of what was going wrong. But what was going wrong is it's like selling the trees at too low a price, if they were supposed to go to the -- the tribe, if the proceeds had been. That's -- that's the -- basically the argument."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "I think that's right. The damage- causing activity finally was the approval of these damaging lease amendments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Was the price above the minimum that the Secretary's regulations provided for?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it seems to me the problem then was with the Secretary's regulation, not with what went on here. That regulation was invalid as arbitrary, capricious --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "No. The regulation only set a minimum royalty, and as this Court --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that's -- but that's the point, I mean, in order to leave full negotiating authority to the tribe. And what you're saying is that minimum is so low that it -- it produces, you know, highway robbery. It seems to me that the problem is -- is with the regulation and maybe you can get at it when the regulation is applied this way. I don't know."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "The -- in Mitchell II, for example, there was a claim -- the Mitchell II claims did not track, by the way, specific statutory and regulatory provisions. There was a claim, for example, that was upheld for the failure of the Department of the Interior to -- to develop a system of roads and easements conducive to timber harvesting. There was no statute that required that. There was no regulation that required that. That was part of the trust duty. And there was one other claim that was upheld in Mitchell II, and a statute said, you -- if you're going to deposit these monies into the Federal Treasury, the Federal Government has to get at least 4 percent. It was a minimum 4 percent rate. And the allottees and tribe in the Mitchell case said, just by turning around you could have gotten 8 percent, and the court below said, yes, you can't be satisfied as trustee with the minimum rate. You have to at least strive for the ceiling. And that was upheld. That claim was upheld here. So there were several claims in Mitchell II that were not tracking any specific --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There was not in Mitchell II a statute that -- that sought to place the negotiating power in the hands of the Indians rather than in the hands of the Government. I mean, that's what distinguishes this case. You have here a scheme that is meant to -- meant to place the tribe in -- in charge of its own fate, and -- and it effectively tells the Secretary, we don't want you to negotiate these leases. That's quite a bit different."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Actually that's incorrect. The statutory scheme in Mitchell II, section 406(a), said that the -- the Indians could -- or could sell their timber with the consent of the Secretary. It's the exact same structure as we have here. What we have here is the Indians can lease their coal with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. The approval has a real history."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's certainly not how -- how the Court described it in Mitchell II because the Court spoke about exclusive control, that the United States did all the negotiating, that -- and it made all the arrangements. Now, whatever you -- you say, you have to deal with what is in that opinion, and it does stress the exclusive control of the United States and distinguishes the prior case on the ground that the other case was designed to give the Indians autonomy to deal for themselves."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "The -- the Secretary certainly had exclusive control over whether to approve this transaction, whether to allow the trust asset to be sold or not. He had exclusive control over that, and that is within the contours of the statutes and regulations. And I --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought that the -- the authority came from the lease from the term that the -- that the tribe agreed to, that the -- the authority to adjust the royalty in this case comes from the lease, not from any statute or regulation. Isn't that true?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "That's correct. Of course, that lease itself was approved by the Secretary of the Interior as trustee of these --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Wait. I thought you said some of these were new leases. I mean, that's what confuses me. When I was making that point earlier, you said no, some of them were new leases. Now, the authority to adjust the rate for the new leases certainly didn't exist in the old lease, did it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "That's not even at issue. There is -- there is no secretarial authority to adjust the rate in the new lease."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that -- that's right. So some of your complaint does not rest upon the provision in the original lease that gives the Secretary the power to adjust the rate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Yes. I -- I think in response to Justice Breyer, the -- the event that caused the damages here was the improvident approval, without observation of --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of the new leases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Of the new leases. That is correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So that -- and that -- that's -- there isn't a -- sort of like a statute that says, Secretary, give an approval or not. What there is is the tribe negotiates something. Then they have the director -- the area director, say, okay, that's all right because the tribe asked him to say. And then somebody approve -- appeals to the Department of the Interior under a regulation of the Interior Department allowing any aggrieved party to go appeal. And then the Secretary intervenes in that, and then they don't tell the tribe. And because they don't tell the tribe, the tribe enters into a different lease. That's really what happened."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And it's hard to fit that into the model of the Secretary charging a penny for a tree. The Secretary, in a sense, didn't charge anything for anything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "The Secretary allowed this trust asset to be conveyed for what he knew to be about half of its value. Now, the approval requirement has a history, going back to the first administration of George Washington. In the Trade and Intercourse Acts, Congress first erected what this Court has called the strong shield of Federal law, to prevent Indians from being despoiled in their property. And Congress, when it legislates, legislates against this rich history, this background in the context of the approval requirement. In the Anicker case in 1987, in a leasing context, the -- the Court said that the -- this strong shield of Federal -- of Federal law was designed to protect the Indians from the designs of those who would take their property for less than fair compensation. That's the -- that's the meat of the approval --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay. So you're saying the approval was wrong for two reasons, I guess. Number one, the rate approved was less than half fair value."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So that, in effect, every -- every lease that was approved at the 12-and-a-half percent was wrongly approved."

    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "This is 12,500 btu coal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I stand corrected. So it was the -- the approval was wrong simply because the -- the particular value of this coal meant that it was being conveyed away for -- for half what it was worth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's the substance. And then you're also making the argument that it was wrong -- and I think I used the word, the -- the bargaining process was skewed, but you're -- you're making that argument too?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Yes. The Secretary should have known that the end result was going to be unfair because he had skewed the bargaining."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay. May -- may I ask you this question as to whether he really did skew it? As I understand what the skewing might be, it would be simply the refusal of the Secretary to allow the administrative process to go forward, as a result of which the tribe ended up negotiating when it might not otherwise have negotiated. It might have held out. My question is this. Didn't someone -- and I forget who it was now -- on behalf of the Secretary come right out and say to the tribe, the Secretary or the Department or the Bureau thinks it would be better if you resolved this by negotiating? And isn't it fair to say that that is practically saying, look, we're not going to decide this thing? You go out and decide it by negotiating. And if that is true, didn't they, in effect, tell them in substance what they were doing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "Well, the beneficiary of a trust shouldn't have to guess what his trustee is really telling him. If that's what the trustee wanted to say, the trustee should have said, I've met with Peabody. I like their lobbyist. I'm not going to do something that Peabody doesn't like, and -- and we're going to sit on this thing, as his subordinate said, until hell freezes over until you agree that -- with something that Peabody likes and you can live with. If we had been given that information, we would have taken a much different approach. I guarantee you. Now, I think Justice O'Connor made the point that if all we have -- if -- if the trust duty only applies to specific statutory and regulatory violations, then it's meaningless. The trust duty has to be something greater than that. And this Court in the Varity Corporation case about 6 years ago said precisely that. The trust duty has to be something greater than the sum of these distinct parts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So -- so the mere designation of a trustee in these cases is a waiver of sovereign immunity?"

  {
    "speaker": "FRYE",
    "speech": "I would say not, Your Honor. There has to be this overlay of comprehensive Federal control and supervision. And I would note too in the Indian Tucker Act, it doesn't restrict Indian plaintiffs to the same rights and remedies. It gives people -- Indian tribes and Indian people the same access to the court, and it uses a different word. It uses the word laws in the -- in the jurisdictional statute in the Indian Tucker Act. And we know from Illinois versus City of Milwaukee and other cases that laws means Federal common law and the -- and if there's anything that's grounded in the Federal common law tradition, it's the trust duty owed to Indian tribes. And that's what we sue under, the Indian Tucker Act. One month ago yesterday, President George Bush once again issued a presidential proclamation, following those of President Reagan and President Clinton, honoring the Navajos and recognizing their special service to the United States in times of war. And as this Court indicated in the Shoshone case, the Navajo tribe was entitled to a fidelity at least as constant. We respectfully urge affirmance."

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Frye. Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Justice Stevens. First, with several factual points. The tribe did know the substance of -- of what had happened with respect to Secretary Hodel. As I pointed out earlier, Mr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint appendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said, from Washington that -- that it was requested there that they go back to negotiations. And also I would call the Court's attention to page 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the negotiating session -- first negotiating session that occurred after that on August 30th, 1985. It's a note in which Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that Secretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try to reach an agreement. So it's clear that the parties entered into these negotiations with a full understanding of -- of what the Secretary's preferred course was. Secondly, I think it's -- it's completely not true that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to the Navajo Nation. The -- on page 117 of the joint appendix, there's a copy of the directive that -- or the -- the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the Assistant Secretary about this. And he makes four very significant points entirely reasonable under the circumstances. He -- he referred to the fact that affirming the decision outright unilaterally might lead to prolonged litigation, during which the -- Peabody might well put the -- the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn't get them. It would impair the future ongoing contractual relationship between the parties. Peabody has a huge presence on the reservation, and it was obviously beneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and not just this isolated royalty increase under this one lease, but a whole host of issues that were -- that were facing the two parties: taxation, payment for water, other -- other leases in which there was a significant increase. And those other leases, by the way, did not have an adjustment clause. So the tribe here got the benefit not only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on a lease that did not have an adjustment clause. And Secretary Hodel then said it would be preferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then importantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final decision on the merits of the appeal. I just think it would be better if the parties went back and negotiated. And since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease provision that was -- protected both parties, what is reasonable for both parties, it was certainly an appropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say -- in the normal situation where you have a -- a disagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send the parties back and seek to have them negotiate. Also, I would point out on page 125 of the joint appendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he points out that the Secretary is aware of each party's concerns about the settlement, again making it clear that -- that the Department in Washington was aware of the state of affairs out there. So the only -- the only -- aside from all of that, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the 1987 lease amendments are essentially procedural or tort claims, or claims about improper regulation of -- of a negotiating process. They aren't the sort of money- mandating statutory or -- first of all, there's no claim -- no -- no identification of a statutory or regulatory provision that -- that specifically regulates this and was violated. But in any event, just like the Due Process Clause that this Court held in Testan is not money-mandating, the same is true here as well."
