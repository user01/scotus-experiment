      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The parties on both courts below agree on at least two things, first, that section 201(c) represents a compromise that assures freelance authors that they may control and exploit their individual contributions to collective works like newspapers and magazines in new anthologies and serializations and screenplays and other derivative works unless they've expressly transferred that right. The parties are also agreed as are both courts below that 201(c) assures the publication of collective works that the publisher of such collective works has the aggregate right to publish any article in the collective work both in publishing the collective work itself of course, but also in publishing that article, quote, as part of any revision of that collective work, again unless there has been an express transfer of the right. Now the principal impetus for this measure was a rather strong wish to undo several quite notorious rulings like that of the Southern District of New York in the Geisel case in 1968 which of course involved the legendary Dr. Seuss and denied him the right to stop the unauthorized distribution of toy dolls that were derived from cartoons that he had published decades earlier. There is no hint at all in the history of this measure and I think no hint in the way it's written that microfilm, for example, which had been in use for some 40 years at the time this measure was passed and which people used to make copies of individual articles more often than to make copies of entire cumbersome periodicals was seen by anyone as a problem to be addressed or solved by 201(c)."

It would be kind of pointless now when almost everything has to go onto the Internet or be preserved in some other way other than print and they said that our contract will automatically cover print and electronic rights. And what's interesting is that the royalties didn't change a cent after that. I think it's a kind of belief in magic that leads some people to think that if there's an inequity of bargaining power it will be solved by creating two estates rather than one. In fact, in the mid 1980s it's interesting that the respondents went to Congress, the National Writers Union went to Congress and tried to get a measure much more modest than this one, a measure that would say that when there is a demonstrable inequity in bargaining power, an unconscionable arrangement, and when that's shown by individualized proof there could be a transfer of rights. Here they want a wholesale, global transfer which I don't think is necessarily going to change anything for the future but could have very serious impact on existing writings whose authors and heirs and assigns are going to be extremely difficult to locate."

That's why a number of Pulitzer Prize winning historians have said they're afraid of what it will do to their research. That's why the American Library Association which is an amicus on their side has conceded that it's awfully difficult to find these people and there may be an adverse impact. Even the register of copyright in the letter to which you referred, Justice O'Connor said there may be an impact on scholarship and research. And I think that's an understatement."

So I don't think the statute of limitations will solve the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It's hard for me to see that that's going to be the effect in the real world because after all these authors have an interest in exposure, it's just like a lot of people now no longer have to be artists for hire are that anyway, because they will give the copyright to the patron, they want people to get to know who they are."

      "speaker": "TRIBE",

I think the erasures of a lot of these things will not be in the interest of the people whose work may be erased but someone who wrote an article in 1980 and maybe was 60 years old at the time and maybe isn't around at the moment, there are a lot of people like that. We don't know how many. We don't know how many articles, but the U.S. News and World Report has already decided in anticipation because there's no -- they think no analytic difference between microfilm and some of these products, certainly the GPO CD-ROM which is a photographic copy is not different, they've stopped putting their work on microfilm. The line drawing problem here, if I may say, is one of several reasons why recalibrating the balance that Congress struck is a particularly inappropriate job for the Court."

There is a provision that says that they can take the -- get the benefit of the presumption that all of our gross income was attributable to their contribution and the theory of that would I suppose be that they don't need a theory because the statute says it, but the theory would be that all of the work we put in electronic form would not have been worth anything if it looked like Swiss cheese with stuff missing."

But the point is there are something like 100,000 freelance articles just on Nexis. There are 18,000 journals on Nexis. You don't have to multiply 100,000 or 50,000 or 20,000 by a very large number to know that a good business judgment for a lot of these companies is going to be who wants the litigation, and you couldn't put together class actions to solve the problem easily, given Amchem and Ortiz because of the incredible variability of the contracts of the -- some of them, for example, will have registered the copyright in the article within three years of its publication and then be eligible for statutory damages, others won't. They'll be plaintiff-specific defenses, statutes of limitations and laches. You mentioned the statute of limitations, Justice Ginsberg.

The part that I'm having difficulty understanding and I don't actually understand this is what precisely, precisely say in the case of Nexis was the event that you think the other side is saying changed the work from a revised work to a new work. In particular I'm thinking, say, at ten in the morning on May 11th, 2001, the Washington Post has a piece of paper, it's called the Washington Post. And then in a analogous form that piece of paper is in its computer. And then something happens. That is, there's a transfer of that information over to Nexis and what, I'd like you to focus right on that, because what you -- I want to know what event in that series of events on that morning we're talking about as being the copying, the unlawful copying."

And then a little later a few more are sent, and when they arrive in Nexis, they are nowhere stored in a form that is in any sense analogous to that page or several pages in the Washington Post, but rather is in a large computer where they are mixed with hunting fishing journal and everything else."

The statute couldn't be clearer, we believe, in the proposition that the collective works copyright owner has no copyright in the individual article in these free-lance situations where there is the separate author copyright. It seems to us that the clearest lesson from that is that if the publisher were in print terms to publish reprints of individual articles and treat them separately that would be an infringing action, the publisher would be exploiting the article as an article and without any authorization."

At that point there's nothing, on that theory, there is nothing left of the fact that the author is the copyright holder in the article. We thought that was the starting point, that the one thing that is plain is that the collective work copyright holder cannot exploit the article as an article, as a separate freestanding work.

It doesn't have the pictures, it doesn't have the graphs. I don't care about that for the moment. Assume you lose on that one. I have the electronic analog which is close enough. And then what happens is somebody pushes the send button and at one instance of time that electronically is transmitted to Nexis where it's on a chip. Now all that happens after that, where we have the electronic analog on a chip, is some electronic signals are added by Nexis to parts of the chip so that any user of Nexis who wants to can call it up like any other thing, article by article.

The -- every step from the first step taken by the newspapers and breaking this down into article files coding it, providing those article files to Nexis where they are further coded and inputted, not necessarily in sequence, is to create a system in which the article files can be exploited as individual files, as individual articles.

It is disaggregated from the word go, that is, when they put together the computer text file that's going to go to the printer they do it article by article because as it happens, that's what goes into a newspaper. That exact text, and you'll see it unmistakably in the record, is exactly what is sent."

      "speech": "Well, sometimes indexing codes, but not only for articles. You've got to be able to find this stuff. You can't just wander around inside a computer. And it is the readers guide to periodicals. That's what we've got here. Whether it is in written form or in index form, it's the same thing. So point one, they don't deliberately disaggregate. Point two, if you look at 349 A of the joint appendix, that's one of many places, I just happened to find this one, where they say they're not claiming any contributory or vicarious liability with respect to infringements by end users. Their whole theory was putting this stuff in the way that the 20th and 21st centuries has to do it is an infringement. It's really a quite Luddite theory. Their distinction with microfilm is that microfilm is a piece of something, you can see it. Well, what about the CD-ROM, then? You can't see it except with a machine. It just looks like it might be Joan Baez singing, but it turns out it's got volume upon volume of material. There's nothing fancy that's done here to facilitate violation. What they're doing is making entire bunch of material available and I didn't hear an answer to Justice Breyer's question. If we read the law the way they propose to read it and I still don't know the exact moment they think is an infringement and how analytically it differs from Justice Stevens' library example, we're going to have a serious problem with our kids doing homework and with professors of history finding out what happened in the middle of the 20th century. It seems to me that before this Court takes a step like that it should pause."
