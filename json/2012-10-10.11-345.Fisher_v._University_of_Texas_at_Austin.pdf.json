First --"

As I said -- and there are several factors in this case that are quite different. First, there is a Constitutional injury as such, and the Court has recognized it.

And in Bakke, the contention was he couldn't have gotten into the medical school; therefore, he has no case. The Court said, in footnote 14 to Justice Powell's opinion, that's a matter of merits; it is not a matter of standing. I think in -- in Parents Involved, the same type of contention was made with respect to the Louisville class plaintiffs, whose son had been admitted to the school of his choice, and the Court said damages are enough to sustain standing.

This is the exclusive way that the University is attempting to increase minority enrollment. Then, if we had no 10 percent solution, under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, I think that there would be flaws under Grutter, even if you assumed away something that can't be assumed away because it is a matter of Texas law, that is, there is a top 10 percent program, and that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, then the -- the question is can you have both? But it seems to me that this program is certainly no more aggressive than the one in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, I don't agree with that, and let me explain why. In order to satisfy Grutter, you first have to say that you are not just using race gratuitously, but it is in the interest of producing a critical mass of otherwise underrepresented students. And so to -- to be within Grutter framework, the first question is, absent the use of race, would we be generating a critical mass? To answer that question, you start -- you've got to examine in context the so-called soft factors that are in Grutter -- you know, are -- is there an isolation on campus? Do members of minority feel that they cannot speak out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "The one social studies that this University did said that minority students, overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are feeling isolated. So what do -- why isn't that even under your test? We can go back to whether substantial evidence is adequate, is necessary, or not. Why does their test fail?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, the survey was -- a random survey. It's not reported in any systematic way. They evidently interviewed students. And it was all about classroom isolation. It wasn't about --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

In looking up, we have a two-court rule. And two courts have found, it seems to me, that here, there is a certain thing -- there is no quota. It is individualized. It is time limited. It was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral means. Each applicant receives individual consideration, and race did not become the predominant factor. So I take those as a given. And then I want to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in that it was not satisfied here? The ones I listed, two courts say are the same. So maybe there's some others."
  },

    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "I'm not sure we agree with those courts in their method of analysis."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well -- and -- particularly in the case of considering alternatives that have worked about as well, I think that's a legal question this Court is free to act on."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "So if I might try to answer your question, there was no effort in this case to establish a -- even a working target for critical mass. They simply ignored it. They just used words, and they said, we've got to do more. So they never answered the predicate question, which Grutter asks: Absent the use of race, can we generate a critical mass? So -- I mean, that's -- that's a flaw we think is in Grutter. We think it's necessary for this Court to restate that principle. Now, whether that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "That -- that's a normal fact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether there is -- is or is not a critical mass?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So could you tell me what a critical mass was? I'm looking at the number of blacks in the University of Texas system. Pre-Grutter, when the state was indisputably still segregating, it was 4 percent. Today, under the post-Grutter system, it's 6 percent. The 2 percent increase is enough for you, even though the state population is at 12 percent? Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the 2 percent increase?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, we don't believe that demographics are the key to underrepresentation of critical mass."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "No -- putting aside -- I don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that, if demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat concerned. But you can't seriously suggest that demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in combination with how isolated or not isolated your student body is actually reporting itself to feel?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, I think, if you start to split out subgroups of minorities, you mistake, I think -- what I think is the proper thrust of Grutter, or at least ought to be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "It might be insulting -- it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Why -- why don't you seriously suggest that? Why don't you seriously suggest that demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the state has nothing to do with whether somebody feels isolated, that if you're in a state that is only 1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not isolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Certainly -- racial balance --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "I wish you would take that position because it seems, to me, right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, racial balancing is not a permissible interest. And we have constantly -- this Court has constantly held not a permissible interest. And that is something we certainly agree with. Trying to respond to Justice Sotomayor and -- and in the framework of Grutter, what you're looking at is, do you -- does this person, member of a so-called underrepresented minority -- it's a concept we don't necessarily accept, but it's Texas' concept -- are they isolated? Are they unable to speak out? And I think we've always said, if you have a very large number, as Texas did in 2004, when they ostensibly made the decision to reinstitute race, they had a 21 percent admission percentage of what they called the underrepresented minorities. They also had about an 18 percent admission ratio of Asian Americans. So on campus, you're talking about -- about 40 percent of the class being minorities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Now, but the test is -- the test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the opinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass is, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out. That's the test. And that wasn't in Grutter or was in Grutter? And in your opinion, it was in Grutter?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Yes. It said expressly in Grutter --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Isolated. And the reason it was satisfied there and not here is?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "In Grutter, the Court assumed that the very small number of admissions -- minority admissions, looked at as the whole -- and it was looked at as a whole, only as a whole in Grutter -- would have yielded about 3 or 4 percent minority admission in a class of 350, which means about 12 to 15 students --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So what are you telling us is the standard of critical mass? At what point does a district court or a university know that it doesn't have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that has happened in that particular state over decades, that it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has to change its rules. What's that fixed number?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "We -- it's not our burden to establish the number. It was the burden of the University of Texas to determine whether --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Well, they told -- they told the district court. They took a study of students. They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they determined in their educational judgment that greater diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of their educational program and one that includes diversifying classes. So what more proof do you require?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, if you are allowed to state all the grounds that need to be proved, you will always prove them, in all fairness, Justice Sotomayor. The question is, they have --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Well, but given it was in the evidence, what more do you think they needed? I think I hear all you saying in your brief is the number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is necessary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "What we're saying in the brief was they were generating, in fact, a very substantial number of minority presence on campus."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "That's what you're saying?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "No. And that immediately thrust upon them the responsibility, if they wanted to -- you know, essentially move away from equal treatment, they had to establish, we have a purpose, we are trying to generate a critical mass of minorities that otherwise could not be achieved."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Tell me -- all right. Tell me what about their use of race did not fit the narrow tailoring -- not the necessity prong as you've defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter required? How is race used by them in a way that violated the terms of Grutter?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "And for this purpose --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Assuming that the need is there. I know you're challenging the need."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, put -- put aside whether this was necessary and whether it was an appropriate last resort in -- in a quest for diversity and critical mass because Grutter's not without limits. But I'll put that aside, and let me come directly to your question. First of all, if you think about narrow tailoring, you can't tailor to the unknown. If you have no range of evaluation, if you have no understanding of what critical mass means, you can't tailor to it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So you have to set a quota for critical mass?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "No. There's -- there's a huge difference, and it's an important one that is not well put out by the University of Texas. Having a range, a view as to what would be an appropriate level of comfort, critical mass, as defined in Grutter, allows you to evaluate where you are --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So we won't call it a quota, we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you shouldn't have."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think it's very important to distinguish between the operative use of that range. In other words, that's where we are, and we're going to use race until we get there, every year, in consideration of each application, which was a problem --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Boy, it sounds awfully like a quota to me, that Grutter said you should not be doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you shouldn't be setting quotas. You should be setting an individualized assessment of the applicants. Tell me how this system doesn't do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. -- Mr. Rein, it seems to me that, in your talking about critical mass, you are relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough. They don't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so they don't need any more. And I tried to get you rigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan. This is the entire plan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, let me tell you that, if you look outside the top 10, at the so-called AI/PAI admits only -- forget the top 10 for a minute, they were generating approximately 15 percent minority admissions outside the top 10, which is in -- above what the target was in Grutter. So this is not Grutter on its facts. It's vastly different. This is a --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Because of the 10 percent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "No, it was -- I'm talking about only the non-top 10 percent admissions. 15 percent of those were so-called underrepresented minorities. This is without the top 10. Now, the top 10 is also a major generator of admissions for underrepresented minorities."
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And this was -- and this was before the adoption of the plan."

    "speaker": "REIN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I'm sorry. Now, I'm confused. I thought the 15 percent figure was the one that was arrived at with the 10 percent plan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "No. With the 10 percent plan, it's much higher. In 2004, it was 21 percent for just Hispanics and African Americans, and these are the categories they used. If you add in Asians, it was over 38 percent. But I'm isolating -- in response to Justice Ginsburg, I'm isolating to the non-top 10 admissions. Those are over 15 percent in that year, and they average very close to that over time. So the -- the total generation of minority presence is a combination of the two in fact, but the AI/PAI system -- which was adopted in response to Hopwood, it was -- as Texas says, it was the first thing they tried to accommodate to their loss of the ability to use race directly, which came up in Hopwood. So that was their first response, to look at a more balanced admission program between Academic Index and Personal Achievement Index. So it is not a system which just excludes minorities."

If we take Texas at its word, and it says they are satisfied, they are happy going on with the way they apply race today, we tried to measure, well, what difference is it making? And could you achieve the same thing with a reasonably available race-neutral alternative? That's a question that was asked in Grutter. They were supposed to analyze that. They didn't look at it.

Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about 3 and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe.

There are admissions that would not have taken place, but for; somebody else would have had that place, but for the use of race. And I think, Justice Kennedy, just to answer your question fully, you have to analyze race-neutral alternatives. And if you look at Parents Involved, that -- that was the critical question. The out -- the outcomes were so small, that there were readily available alternatives."

Which or both of those are you arguing?"

And certainly, it -- race should have been a last resort. It was a first resort. That's, in a nutshell, that prong of it. And in order -- and they failed in every respect. If you go to narrow tailoring, what we are saying is they didn't consider alternatives, and their treatment of, as we have pointed out, Asian Americans and Hispanics makes a -- an incomprehensible distinction. They say, we don't worry about Asians, there are a lot of Asians, it's a demographic measure, which is a forbidden measure. They are in excess of their share of the Texas population. But if you are trying to find individual comfort levels, if you are breaking it down between African Americans and -- and Hispanics, the --"

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Counsel, you are the one who, in your brief, has assumed that they are valuing different races differently. But Asian numbers have gone up, under however they have structured this PAI. And as I understand their position, race is balanced against other issues like socioeconomics, the strength of the classes people took. It's never a standalone. So even a white student, I presume, who goes to an -- an entirely black or an entirely Latino school, who becomes class president, would get some points because he has or she has proven that they foster or can deal in a diverse environment. That's how I understood their plan, that it's not just giving you a plus because of race. It's combining that with other factors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "There is a plus because of race. There are many other factors in the decision. And might I say that this -- the white student president of the class in an ethnically different school is a measure of leadership. Leadership is an independent factor in the PAI. It isn't -- he is not getting that point because he's -- because of his race; he's getting that point because of his leadership. That's a race-neutral criteria could work for anybody. So race is an independent add-on. It -- it is something they can use to boost the PAI score, the PAS element in any way they like, because they say they contextualize it. And we've said it's not necessary, it's not narrowly tailored, it ignores available alternatives, it treats -- gives disparate treatment to Asian Americans because they are minorities as well. And to the extent it depends on the classroom factor, there is simply no way to relate or fit what they are doing to the solution of the problem which they used as a major foundation of their proposal, which is the nondiverse classroom. That -- certainly, there is just no correspondence there. I see my time is up, Mr. Chief Justice."

    "speaker": "GARRE",

First, if you just looked at the numbers -- we don't think it's the numbers, but if you looked at the numbers, after 7 years, racial diversity among these groups at the University of Texas had remained stagnant or worse. 2002, African American enrollment had actually dropped to 3 percent. That's one part of it. The other part of it is, if you look at the admissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the -- the top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high school may get you diversity that looks okay on paper, but it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces educational benefits on campus. And that's one of the considerations that the university took into account as well."

But you say, well, it's -- it's faulty because it doesn't admit enough African Americans and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds. And you specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas. Now, that's your -- that's your argument? If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another corporate lawyer.

Colleges and universities across the country have relied on that principle in shaping their admissions policies, and it is of vital interest to the United States that they continue to be able to do so.

The top 10 percent plan certainly does produce some ethnic diversity. Significant numbers get in. The problem is the university can't control that diversity in the same way it can with respect to the 25 percent of the class that is admitted through the holistic process. So my understanding of what the university here is looking to do, and what universities generally are looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant a preference for privilege, but to make individualized decisions about applicants who will directly further the educational mission. For example, they will look for individuals who will play against racial stereotypes just by what they bring: The African American fencer; the Hispanic who has -- who has mastered classical Greek.

We have findings by both courts below -- and I'm reading from the court of appeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33. \"The district court found that race is indisputably a meaningful factor that can make a difference in the evaluation of a student's application.\" If it doesn't make a difference, then we have a clear case; they're using race in a way that doesn't make a difference. The supposition has to be that race is a determining factor. We've heard a lot about holistic and all that. That's fine. But unless it's a determining factor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't serve the purpose at all. That can't be the situation."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "That -- that is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that it's not a mechanical factor. Now, with respect to the implementation of -- and the narrow tailoring inquiry, with respect to the University's implementation of this -- of its compelling interest, I do think it's clear that, although the Petitioner says she's challenging implementation, that this plan meets every requirement of Grutter and addresses the concern of Justice Kennedy that you raised in dissent in Grutter. Whether Texas had to or not, it did address that concern. There's no quota. Everyone competes against everyone else. Race is not a mechanical automatic factor. It's an holistic individualized consideration. And because of the way the process is structured, they do not monitor the racial composition on an ongoing basis."
  },

    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

There are not two identical candidates because there are not identical mechanical factors that -- except the 10 percent plan. Under the PIA, the factors are so varied, so contextually set, that no two applicants ever could be identical in the sense that they hypothesize."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "VERRILLI",
    "speech": "Yes. But the key, Mr. Chief Justice, is the way it makes a difference. And it makes a difference by casting the accomplishments of the individual applicant in a particular light, or the potential of an individual applicant in a particular light. What -- what universities are looking for principally with respect to this individualized consideration is what is this individual going to contribute to our campus? And race can have a bearing on that because it can have a bearing on evaluating what they've accomplished, and it can have a bearing for the reasons I tried to identify earlier to Justice Alito on what they can bring to the table, what they can bring to that freshman seminar, what they can bring to the student government, what they can bring to the campus environment --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

I think -- I don't think that this is a situation in which the Court simply affords complete deference to the University's judgment that it hasn't yet achieved the level of diversity that it needs to accomplish its educational mission. I think that the Court ought to -- has to make its own independent judgment. I think the way the Court would go about making that independent judgment is to look at the kind of information that the university considered. That could be information about the composition of the class. It could be information about classroom diversity. It could be information about retention and graduation rates. It can be information about -- that's specific to the university's context in history. Is it a university that has had a history of racial incidents and trouble or not? A series of factors. And then what the Court's got to do is satisfy itself that the University has substantiated its conclusion based on that -- based on the information it's considered, that it needs to consider race to further advance the educational goals that Grutter has identified as a compelling interest. And I will say, I do think, as the number of minority enrollees gets higher, the burden on the university to do that is going to get harder to meet. But I don't think -- I don't think there is a number, and I don't think it would be prudent for this Court to suggest that there is a number, because it would raise exactly the kind of problem that I -- that I think Justice Kennedy identified in the Grutter dissent of creating hydraulic pressure towards that number."

I'm just saying, these are all reserved questions and they don't go to standing. The Court made that clear in Bakke. Let me go to another issue that, you know, I think I never completed my answer to Justice Breyer. Where we stand on what you should do about Grutter is as follows. We recognize, as in the words of -- that the Solicitor General just issued -- that there is an interest which is cognizable in diversity. That is -- that was the root question in Grutter, could you recognize it at all. But what we are concerned about, as you are seeing here, is universities like UT and many others have read it to be green light, use race, no end point, no discernible target, no critical mass written, you know, in circumstances reduced to something that can be reviewed. And as long as you don't cross two lines, determinative points and fixed quotas -- \"quotas\" meaning we will fill this quota exclusively with who we deem to be under-represented -- you are okay. We don't think that's the way Grutter was intended. Grutter was intended to say this is an area of great caution; using race itself raises all kinds of red flags, so before you use race make a determination whether really, your interest in critical mass -- that is, in the dialogue and interchange, the educational interest, is that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "You are not suggesting that if every minority student that got into a university got into only the physical education program; and in this particular university that -- that physical education program includes all the star athletes; so every star athlete in the school happens to be black or Hispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now reached the critical mass of 10, 15, 20 percent -- that the university in that situation couldn't use race?"
  },
  {

  {
    "speaker": "REIN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "No, it's just that every one of their students who happens to be a minority is going to end up in that program. You don't think the university could consider that it needs a different diversity in its other departments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, if that were the case, remember the factor that is causing it, and you are assuming, is choice. You have a critical mass of students. They choose to major in different things, and that's one of the base problems with the classroom diversity concept. They never asked the question why, if 40 percent of our students are minorities, are they not in the small classrooms? Why does that happen? Statistically you would say that's an aberration. You might ask the question what's causing it? Because in order to fit --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Aren't they saying the same thing when they say, when we are looking at the holistic measure, we are looking for that student who is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear scientist?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "No. Because they don't take into account your interests, they don't ask you, are you going to join ROTC, they don't ask you are you going to major -- major in physics. And when it comes time in the UT system to allocate access to different majors, they do that in a way that is basically premised on academic index. So they have a two-tiered admission system. They are only here focused -- their preference goes to admission as such, it doesn't go to sorting people out by majors. And if I might then say to Justice Breyer, I think our answer is, when we see what UT is doing, what we that -- Grutter's -- you know, it has been perceived as a green light; go ahead and use race, race which is otherwise really a highly questionable, an abominable kind of sorting out. That unchecked use of race, which we think is -- has been spawned by misreading of Grutter, needs to be corralled. So what we --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Is it any more unchecked than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off in 1978, decided by Justice Powell? Is it any different from how race is used in our military academies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, I mean, they are two different questions. The Harvard plan is a very different world. It's a plan of wholly individualized admission comparing individuals one on one, to establish the platonic ideal of the class as the educational mission. This is not what is going on at UT. This is not an individualized, I will look at you. I will score you. I will score you individually. But as they keep saying, at the point of admission, I am not admitting people; I am admitting categories, boxes; and that relates to Justice Alito's question. I thought your hypothetical, Justice Alito, was entirely fair, because in the way they do their system, in the PAI scoring, you can figure out that two people would have had the same PAI score but for race. It's an add-on. It allows them to boost the PAS component of the PAI score. So -- it is not infrequent. There are many, many candidates who will score the same PAI, may even have the same AI, and then you boost some of them. Now, what UT says is, well, we don't boost all the minorities. And that -- as they've stood here today, and they said in their briefs, we want to boost the ones we like. We want those affluent minorities who we think will improve, in our view, dialogue. That is contrary indeed to the fact that they give points in the same system for socioeconomic disadvantage. It's at odds with itself. But it's purely race, and it comes to the ultimate question then, which, Chief Justice, you were asking: Where is the end point? If you have nothing to gauge the success of the program, if you can't even say at the beginning we don't have critical mass because we don't know what it is and we refuse to say what it is, there is no judicial supervision, there is no strict scrutiny and there is no end point to what they are doing. So what we have said, and it comes right back to Justice Breyer, how would you write it, you can clarify it, you can say Grutter properly applies, requires you to do A, B, C, and -- and we've said in our brief that would be satisfactory. But to the extent that you then have it surviving side by side, there could be enormous confusion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "So what you want me to do is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what the underlying determinations of critical mass were there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas -- which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will then find enough of a difference that I can write some words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REIN",
    "speech": "Well, I'm saying if you clarify the needs and the necessity point, if you then look at some of the other deficiencies and clarify the -- the consideration of reasonably available alternatives as a necessity, if you then attribute that -- you attribute the weaknesses of the Texas program to the absence of those factors, I think you can fashion a result in this case which may or may not have to, quote, \"overrule\" Grutter. It's really a matter, what do you -- do you want to clearly restate what it is that allows the use of this odious classification? That's what we are talking about, it's a narrow window; and it should be stated as a narrow window."

    "speech": "Justice Sotomayor, I don't want to gut it. And the only way one could reach that conclusion is to assume that Grutter is an unlimited mandate without end point to just use race to your own satisfaction and to be deferred to in your use of race. That is unacceptable. That is the invasion of Abigail Fisher's rights to equal protection of the law. Thank you."
