One, the per­prisoner approach best comports with the statutory text. Two, the per­prisoner approach is the only one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and preserving their right to bring meritorious ones. And three, the per­prisoner approach avoids anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never have intended, disincentives such as discouraging prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their income month after month. I would like to, of course, start with the text. The key sentence is in ­­ the key sentence is the second sentence of Subsection (b)(2).

So there's the initial partial filing fee. He or she is always going to have to pay that. There's the three­strikes rule, which comes into being.

Now, that makes perfect sense if the filing fees are all in one case, going to a single clerk. But if you're right and what they mean is the filing fees are in multiple cases, then it doesn't make sense to say that the agency shall forward payments to the clerk. The only way to make that sentence makes sense, if the filing fees are in multiple cases, is for Congress ­­ is for the statute to have read, the agency shall forward payments to many clerks or to several clerks seriatim.

And I'd also point to Section 1915(d), which has the statutory language, \"The officers of the court shall issue and serve all process and perform all duties in such cases.\" So there are references to more than one case in various plays. But even if it was written in a singular way, in a way to deal only with one case, that really doesn't prove anything against us. It just means you got to look to other statutory construction tools, because it would just say that there's going to be an initial partial filing fee in every case.

But the answer to the question, Justice Ginsburg, of whether he's never going to pay those, again I would go back to 1995 and say Congress thought, well, they could be paid relatively quickly if the filing fees were lower. But you ­­ you touch on a question that is unsettled in the lower courts, which is does the amount come due at the end of when the prisoner ­­ when the prisoner sentence ends? And the courts of appeals are divided about that, with the Fifth Circuit saying, yes, it does come due, and you have to come up with some kind of a plan with each of the clerks to which you owe money, and you shall pay it off.

It does come due, but it only comes due and you have to pay it if you're not in forma pauperis at the time the government seeks to collect it after you're out ­­ out of release.

As the ­­ the Second Circuit noted in the Whitfield case, that single case produced five encumbrances. It was a district court appeal, it was a district court case, a Second Circuit appeal. There were two cost awards from the district court and the court of appeals, and there was a second appeal. There were five encumbrances in one single piece of litigation. So these encumbrances can add up quite quickly, and you can get up to five, seven, eight. And that case, it was a meritorious case, the Second Circuit said. It wasn't a frivolous case.

So what we're talking about here is Subsection (b), which is the filing fee provision, and it says, first, that an IFP prisoner has to pay the full amount of each action or appeal, talking about a single action or appeal, and then it sets out an installment plan, which is an initial payment and a monthly payment.

So for example, in Subsection (b)(3), Congress talks about the amount of fees permitted by statute for a civil action or an appeal. In (b)(1) it talks about any court fees required by law for an action or appeal. Similarly, in (a)(1) and (a)(2) it talks about fees, plural, for a ­­ a single action or a single appeal. And to be clear, we think that in this statute Congress used \"fee\" and \"fees\" somewhat interchangeably in the way that people do out in the world; that people would say \"attorney's fees,\" \"an attorney fee award,\" \"fee shifting,\" \"we're shifting all the fees,\" that sort of thing, that that's just common usage, and that the single/plural fees in Subsection (b)(2) just does not provide the kind of strong indication that would be necessary to overcome the real thrust of the rest of the statute, which is that it's something that a court does for each of these cases.

I guess I'll start with the legal one that numerous courts that have considered this issue have said that once a prisoner is out in the world and is no longer a prisoner but wants to continue his case, he can try to qualify for regular IFP status and no longer have to make his payments.

And that's really the second point that I wanted to make, which is regardless of how you would resolve that legal question, and actually the reason that the administrative office has not, so far as we know, taken a position on that, is because there are serious practical problems to collecting. One of those problems ­­ when you ­­ when you look at the statute, Subsection (b) allows you to take money from the trust accounts, so it's fairly easy to collect while the individual is in prison. But once the person is out in the world, courts ­­ each individual court trying to collect filing fees that are ­­ that the inmates ­­ the former inmate's on the hook for is quite a difficult thing. We have spoken with folks from the administrative office who tell us that there is not now any centralized system for trying to refer those obligations for treasury, and I think you could imagine how cumbersome that would be. So to think that potentially paying five years down the road, or never paying is any kind of marginal deterrent I think would be wrong. We think that Congress knew that there were multiple filers out there, and that if they were going to file more lawsuits, they should pay more. And just to be clear about what Congress was saying here, no one is precluded from going to court. All Congress is saying is something very reasonable, which is if you have funds available and you continue filing more lawsuits and appeals, you should have to pay. You should have to contribute.

Is there any doctrine tantamount to the rule of lenity in interpreting a criminal statute that applies here? Because the thing that strikes me most is the extreme harshness of your position. We're talking about earning 23 cents an hour, filing fees of $350, $505. And the money is used to ­­ for what? Phone calls to family and friends, stamps for letters, and to buy books. And you're going to take the last, you know, whatever so that someone who's in there for 20 years can't even buy a book? That seems very, very harsh. And you seem to be willing to interpret the ambiguity in the statute to save the last $10, but you're unwilling to interpret what I think at least I regard as the ambiguity in the statute to allow prisoners ­­ I mean, they are prisoners. They're not ­­ that's perhaps not entitled to any grace, but who in some States earn 10 cents an hour.

I mean, it is obviously a case to consider. But at least in the BOP's experience, the vast majority of people who have orders owed are for one lawsuit, two lawsuits. Most of the court of appeals' cases below are like that, et cetera. Putting that to the side, of course, this statute never prevents a prisoner from bringing a meritorious case because of the safety­valve provision. We also interpret the $10 amount to leave money in the account. There's also, of course, administrative remedies, which administrative exhaustion is required. So that helps resolve any questions about making sure that claims are heard. And, in fact, the BOP does have the discretion to allow phone calls, et cetera, to indigent prisoner, also stamps, et cetera, et cetera. So in terms of what you potentially perceive as harshness, this only arises in cases where an inmate is filing so many cases, that potentially a large portion of his income used to pay filing fees.

I have asked the BOP for statistics just because I was curious about what is the median income that's received, what is the median deposit. They said that for the ­­ the past fiscal year, the median ­­ median income an inmate receives is approximately $120 a month. So, in fact, with that, if an inmate has 20 percent that he's paying towards filing fees, he could pay them off at a reasonable rate.

And what we found, just checking last week, was that inmates ­­ there are 944 inmates of the over 200,000 in the federal system who are paying on one order, and only 60 inmates of the over 200,000 who are paying on five or more orders or who had six, and then 42 inmates who have six or more orders.

So at the end of the day, we think that the D.C. Circuit got it right, that both when you look at the specific text of this provision, which is Subsection (b) about filing fees but really the entire statute written from the perspective of a single case, a checklist for a single case, that Congress wanted inmates who were filing more lawsuits to pay more. And we think that that makes sense and that also ­­ and I want ­­ this is, I think, a partial answer to one of the prior questions of the Chief Justice in terms of interpretative canons, etc., that it's consistent with what this Court did last term in the Coleman case. In the Coleman case the Court was considering the three­strikes provision, but it recognized that that provision is written from the perspective of a single case, a single action, or appeal. You could get a strike for the action. You could get a strike for the appeal. And the same thing we think is true for the filing fees. You could owe the filing fees for the action. You could owe the filing fees for the appeal. And we think that that makes complete sense. So unless there are further questions, we would urge the Court to affirm the decision of the D.C. Circuit."

      "speaker": "SHELLEY",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, with respect to the ­­ the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor asked, in fact, I think if the account had $11 in it, the government's position would lead to none of the clerks of the courts being paid because the first payment would take the ­­ the balance under $10. So that seems, again, as a number of justices have mentioned, other than Justice Breyer, a perverse reading of the $10 rule. But I also want to take on the idea that this is the only provision in the statute that provides for a financial effect on the prisoner when filing a lawsuit. No ­­ as the Chief Justice mentioned, the initial partial filing fee applies in every case. No $10 rule. No minimum. So that is a ­­ an immediate financial incentive not to file a frivolous lawsuit because money is going to go immediately. And if it doesn't go immediately, it's a debt that gets paid sequentially, much like the per­prisoner approach would adopt for (b)(2). But (b)(2) then takes a longer­term point of view. (b)(1) is an immediate financial disincentive. (b)(2) is the longer financial disincentive month after month with the installment payments. I also want to take on the idea that \"fees\" and \"filing fee\" appear interchangeably in the statute. They do not. Ms. Saharsky mentioned the word \"fees,\" but \"fees\" unadorned with the word \"filing\" in front of it appears differently than does the word \"filing fees.\" The plural \"filing fees\" appears in exactly two spots: (b)(2). And then in the cross­reference to the cost section, I believe it's (f) ­­ in the (f) section where it says that costs shall be charged the same way as filing fees. They both use the plural \"filing fees.\" So this was purposeful. Congress used the plural \"filing fees\" only twice. And that's because, I think, they were talking about the ­­ the numerous cases being paid to a single clerk. And finally, I'd like to say, it has often been said that the measure of a society is not how it treats it's outstanding citizens but how it treats weakest. Here there's no ­­ it's criminals. Here there's no real reason to pile on to prisoners with this additional onerous financial incentive when the other aspects of the PLRA do the work of deterring frivolous lawsuits along with the disincentive that's provided under the per­prisoner approach. We would ask that the Court reverse the D.C. Circuit."
