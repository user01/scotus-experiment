Under the analysis of this Court's decision in NCAA v. Tarkanian, State action exists in this case because first, the regulatory conduct of the TSSAA is attributable to the entity or entities that control the organization and, secondly, Government institutions, in this case public schools, control the TSSAA's conduct and are therefore constitutionally accountable for its regulatory conduct."

It looked exclusively at the State-level relationships, and so we think it overlooked the core ingredients of the Tarkanian analysis. It was the local-level interconnections. There are two levels of State interaction with the TSSAA. At the State level, the State Board of Education for 24 years explicitly designated this organization as its agent to regulate interscholastic athletics for all schools in Tennessee. That was repealed, or changed in 1996, and now it recognizes, continues to recognize the role of the TSSAA and specifically authorizes the schools to maintain their membership in the TSSAA and the court of appeals focused exclusively on that State-level relationship. Under the Tarkanian analysis, Your Honor, the local levels, the public schools that control this organization, that comprise 84 percent of the membership, where there's one school, one vote, control the organization and under the Tarkanian analysis we think the --"

This is -- case is unlike many of this Court's other cases, such as Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, involving a school, Blum v. Yaretsky, involving a nursing home, Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison, involving a private utility. In all of those circumstances, Justice O'Connor, the privateness, if you will, the formal privateness of the organization was assumed, and the question was whether the Government as purchaser, or Government as regulator, transformed that private, concededly private entity into State actor status. In this case, that very threshold question is what is at stake. There is nothing really private, except formally private, about this organization.

They're in the organization because they're a principal of a school, but the Government isn't paying their way, and they're not exercising any State power, really, when they do this. They're just conceiving this award on their own and they're giving it away."

I think in this case the public officials are serving because of their relationship to the school, because they are the principals in the school, and the clearest example of that is in the constitutional provision of the TSSAA regarding vacancies. If there is a person who is a member of the board of control, or a member of the legislative council, and that person's school disaffiliates with the organization, then that person's term of office on the board of control or the legislative council terminates, so it is clear that these persons are not there as individuals, but there as -- in their representative capacity of the schools that they represent."

So that it seems to me that there's no other capacity in which they could be acting than in their public capacity as officials of their -- of the public schools. That is, the public school members. Obviously, the private school members are representing their private schools, but they are a very small minority. And on the question whether it's the board or the membership that's important here, it seems to me -- and membership isn't entirely the right way to describe it. These are voting members. They choose their board, and they can remove their board members, and so it seems to me that the -- it is the membership.

If it doesn't, Tennessee, as a State, in some capacity certainly does have the power to instruct -- to direct the conduct of public education in Tennessee, including the rules that govern interscholastic athletics. If this association is not a State actor, then a gap will open up in the constitutional coverage of public school programs, because schools may often collaborate in providing programs for their students, not only in athletics but also, for example, in language and travel and music and art, in devising and administering standardized tests, and that collaboration should not shelter the programs from constitutional accountability."

The question is, where does the authority for the power exercised by the association come from, and in this case it is quite clear in Brentwood Academy's case and in the case of the other member schools, it comes from the decision, school-by-school, which each school is given the choice to make under State law, of joining the association and abiding by those rules."

Is that a fair distinction?"

At least in Tennessee I don't believe it is, because interscholastic athletic competition in Tennessee has been something that's been entirely voluntary for the history of that competition, dating back all the way to 1925. There has never been a requirement that any public school have interscholastic athletic competitions --"

The meeting that led to the filing of this lawsuit took place on a Saturday at a privately owned hotel, and whether there is reimbursement for the members of the board of control or the legislative council varies from one to the next. There is no standard practice in that respect. In this case there are several problems with the rule of law that's proposed by Brentwood Academy, problems that cause that rule of law to run contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The first problem is that the rule -- and this is even consistent with the Solicitor General's remark. The rule proposed by Brentwood Academy would mean that if schools in extra -- in any extracurricular activity compete with each other in Tennessee, that -- the regulation of that interscholastic activity is going to amount to State action regardless of how it's conducted. Forensics, band competition, cheerleading competition, any sort of regulation of those activities would all be State action. It would --"

An individual public school could not do that, and if an individual -- and that's one of the problems with the amicus briefs in this case, is they suggest that there's no remedy for any sort of discrimination if you hold that TSSAA is not a State actor, and that's simply not the case, because an individual public school still makes the choice of whether it's going to be a member of the association or not, and whether it's going to abide by the rules or not, and if --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

If you're going to use the association to sweep every member up with it, then you are subjecting the private schools --"

      "speaker": "COLBERT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "-- except to the extent that the schools choose to abide by them. The -- ultimately, this case really goes back to Justice O'Connor's first question when Mr. Blumstein stood up and that is, what should the test be and I think, as Justice O'Connor mentioned in the dissent in the Amtrak case, if you look at Blum, if you look at Rendell-Baker, if you look at Jackson, if you look at all the different cases that have phrased the test in all different ways, they really come back to whether the challenged action results from a matter of private choice, and that's exactly what you have here. Membership in TSSAA, service on the board of control, following the rules or not following the rules is a matter of private choice. Brentwood Academy made the private choice that it wanted to play in the TSSAA and compete for TSSAA championships, and now it doesn't want to follow the rules, and that's what this case is about."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "BLUMSTEIN",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The TSSAA has been very candid in stating the breadth of its position, but I'd like to point out on page 32 of its brief their position seems to be that even a coach who is a public school teacher and a public school official is not a State actor, so their position is that extracurricular activities are so outside of the scope of public accountability that even if there is a decision by a coach about a decision affecting athletic contests, that that does not fall within State action. The other -- another point on the question of control, in the joint appendix at page 89 and page 92 it makes it pretty clear that the principals are representatives of the school in voting on the legislative council and on the board of control, and joint appendix 89 and 92 sets that out. And finally, I would like to just indicate, we haven't talked about the existing state of the law, but this circuit, the Sixth Circuit decision is the only decision that finds a comparable institution not to be a State actor. This case is an outlier in that sense. The law has been settled for over 30 years. Some of the concerns that the respondent has I think have not been manifested. The way that the courts have dealt with the issue of reviewing decisions of these associations is through a proper level of deference on a matter of substantive law, and so if the Court affirms below it will be unsettling what has been settled law in every jurisdiction that has heard this case for 30 years. Thank you, Your Honor."
