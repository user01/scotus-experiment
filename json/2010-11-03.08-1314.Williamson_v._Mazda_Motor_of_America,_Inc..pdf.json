American Honda. The claim is not preempted, because it is perfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the objectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208 governing Type 2 seatbelts in rear seats. One point that is clear from this Court's express preemption holding in Geier is that Congress intended common law to play a complementary role in accident victims and promoting greater safety in vehicle design. And, on the issue of implied obstacle preemption, the majority also agreed with the dissent that State common law will not be preempted unless there is clear evidence of a conflict with Federal objectives."

It was not trying to further choice or more effective in preventing fatalities and serious injuries, that they offered greater overall protection for children, and, most fundamentally, that they actually increased seatbelt usage in rear seating positions. Our common law theory seeks to obtain all those exact same safety benefits for aisle seating positions. And we know by 1993, when this vehicle was manufactured, at least one major manufacturer, GM, was in fact installing Type 2 lap/shoulder belts in aisle seating positions.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JAY",
    "speech": "Two responses, Justice Alito. First, the question presented here about Type 1 versus matter of course does not usually participate in private party litigation under State common law, even when that litigation might touch on a State -- the interpretation of a Federal safety standard. And when the courts asked for NHTSA's views, NHTSA generally responds, as this Court asks for the government's views in this case and the government responded. And I think if the Court were to look back to the first brief in a string of briefs that the government has filed about these issues under this act, the brief in Wood versus General Motors filed in 1990, you could predict the position that the government would take in this case from that brief. The government said in that case that options don't preempt, merely because they are options. In most cases there will be no federal policy that presents a conflict. That case presented the case of the passive restraint phase-in and there it was the rare circumstance, as the Court later held in Geier, where there was frustration of the Federal policy, but that's because the Federal policy was to encourage variety, not Type 2 seatbelts the day after the 1989 rulemaking. So there was no conflict. As far as the child safety concern to which Justice Sotomayor alluded, it is referred to in the 1984 denial of a request to impose the rule that later was imposed in 1989. The agency said that it had concerns about how particular child seats, which at the time were anchored with a form of tether. And it said that it thought the continued use of tethered car seats was something that it chose to encourage rather than anchoring them with Type 2 seats. The agency did not speak at all to whether Type 2 versus Type 1 was better for child safety and the agency then answered that in the 1989 rulemaking. So for adults Type 2 seatbelts are safer and they encourage seatbelt use because they are more popular. For infants, the agency specifically asked whether Type 2 seatbelts could be as efficacious as Type 1 seatbelts in holding an infant car seat in place. It concluded that they could. That's set out at page 25 of our brief. And for toddlers, children who are too small to sit in a Type 2 seatbelt without assistance, the agency recommended booster seats. And if there was no booster seat the agency recommended that they not use the shoulder belt. Not that they detached the shoulder belt. The agency indeed specifically rejected the idea that the shoulder belt should be removed at page 47990 of the notice of proposed rulemaking."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JAY",
    "speech": "At the time, no, that lawsuit would not have been preempted. Mr. Buchanan said that that would be harder case and I think he said that because the agency was specifically encouraging Type 2 seatbelts, and in this case Respondents can't show anything suggesting that the agency was encouraging Type 1 seatbelts. So it might be a harder case for that reason, but at that time there were two ways of complying with the Federal minimum standard and the savings clause provides that simply complying with the Federal standard does not preempt the operation of State common law. So we discussed the child safety, the alleged child safety rationale. I want to say a word about the idea that aisle seats were unsafe for the installation of these seatbelts. As Mr. Buchanan mentioned, the agency specifically encouraged the installation of those seats where it was feasible. It was found to be feasible in 1991 by General Motors, which installed them. But another word about that, because Respondents have suggested that the chief counsel of NHTSA has said in 1994 in a letter something favorable to their position, and that letter is reproduced in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply brief. I urge the Court to look at the entire letter and not the sentence that was excerpted several times in Respondents' brief. Because what the agency said was that, in response to someone who complained that manufacturers were installing Type 2 seatbelts and they said, the complainant said that makes these minivans unsafe because people will be trapped in the back seat. The agency said it disagreed, that people could go under the safety belt, that they could detach the safety belt, that the safety benefits of a Type 2 seatbelt outweighed any convenience concern about access to or egress from the rear seat. And I think that is perfectly consistent with the policy NHTSA has taken all along. Type 2 seatbelts are safer, more effective and to be encouraged. When NHTSA decided not to mandate that based on its understanding at the time of who used seatbelts, who used seatbelts in the rear center seats and what the -- how many fatalities and injuries would be prevented and whether the dollar cost would be justified by -- by the dollar equivalent of injuries and fatalities prevented, it wasn't making a preemptive judgment that Type 2 seatbelts, therefore, should not be installed. And for that reason there is no frustration of anything that NHTSA had in mind in the 1989 rulemaking by allowing this tort suit to proceed as saved by the Savings Clause."

Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to try to figure out a way around it.

The agency specifically carried forward that rule in 1989 for the rear inboard seats at issue in this case. Note 1 of Petitioner's reply brief said that the law is exactly the same in 1989 as to these seats as in 1984. It -- hasn't been preempted in 1984, notwithstanding what my friend said here from the government today; and if it was preempted in 1984 it has recognized throughout its history. Under their position, the manufacturer could be sued for having a Type 2 belt by the child who was harmed or by the person in the back row that had difficulty getting out of the car in the event of an accident, just as they could be sued under Petitioner's theory for having a Type 1 belt. This -- the agency recognized, this was a unique situation where there were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs; they wanted to give the -- the manufacturers the flexibility to make this decision, and that flexibility served, the agency concluded, the Federal safety and -- and practicability objectives.

It's expressly granting options and it's making clear in the record that the reason it is doing that is to serve Federal objectives that would be frustrated by the imposition of a particular rule.

And that's important because NHTSA was them with a lap belt because it was more compatible with that. Second of all, that, the reference to the no positive or negative, was a tentative assessment. If you look in the Federal Register where that language appears -- it's on 53 Federal Register 47988 to 47989 -­ the agency said: This is a tentative assessment; we want your comments on this.

This was at a time when many children weren't in any car seats at all, no matter what NHTSA was saying. is terrific for adults is going to take -- is going to create unique chest loads on children.

You had rulemakings in '84 and '89 and it adopted a very unique approach to resolving the safety issue, which was to expressly give manufacturers this option to advance Federal safety and practicability objectives. We haven't talked as much about the practicability objectives, but that is one of the statutory objectives of the act. Congress couldn't have been more clear on that and the agency in 1989 couldn't have been more clear in the final notice, saying we are not going to require manufacturers to install Type 2 belts in the rear center and aisle seats because that's just too costly. It's substantially expensive and the agency well knew based on its history that imposing this sort this case at 52 Federal Register 22819 where it said that requiring these kind of overly costly measures created a lost opportunity to improve safety through other means. This is something that Congress gave the agency the expert judgment to make on these matters and the practicability objectives, which was just as much a statutory objective as a safety objective, would have been directly frustrated if, as could have happened under the Petitioners position in this case, on the very day after the agency passed this rule in 1989 and said we are not going to require rear inboard seats to have Type 2 lap/shoulder belts. A jury in California hit my client with a multimillion dollar punitive damages award because they did not install a Type 2 belt in that seat. That would have been directly contrary to the Federal objectives. It would have undermined the safety objectives that the agency recognized and it would have undermined the practicability objectives that the agency recognized, and then you have this world in that there was one manufacturer, I think General Motors was mentioned, that was doing this Type 2 belt uniformly?"

Truthfully, if you look at late as 2004 when the agency adopted so-called Anton's law rule, which eventually did mandate Type 2 belts in these kinds of seats. Even then the agency recognized that there were still technical feasibility concerns with installing the Type 2 belts in these seats. And just to be clear, the problem is, is finding the anchor to install the shoulder belt in rear center or aisle seats. You have got to anchor it somewhere. If you put it in the side wall you are going to have straps crossing across the aisle and obstructing access. If you put it in the roof you are going to have something -­"

    "speech": "It gave them that flexibility, the agency determined in the 1994 chief counsel letter and we hope the Court does read it, makes it clear that the agency concluded that in this situation, and it's a rare situation, the manufacturer was in the best position to decide what was most appropriate for its vehicles. And, again, there is this flexibility objective. If you look at Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan v. A. la Cuesta, the decision cited on page 19 of our brief, you have this Court recognizing that a Federal law that gave flexibility where you have a state mandate that interferes with that flexibility, that is an actual conflict. Ultimately under Geier, this Court is looking for the existence of an actual conflict. We think a rule that says manufacturers, you are free to choose between this type of seatbelt and that type of seatbelt, and the reason we are giving you that flexibility is to advance federal safety and practicability objectives. We are not going to require you to put a lap/shoulder belt in there because that would frustrate those Federal objectives, the state law tort suit that would mandate the very thing that the agency chose not to, to advance federal objectives is preempted.

Specifically, Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Garre about whether there is anything about the rear center seat being the safest place for children in that regulatory history. There is no mention whatsoever in that regulatory history about that issue, and the reason side impact collision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BUCHANAN",
    "speech": "You are right, Mr. Chief Justice, that was not expressed in any way in terms of a child safety concern. I would also, minor correction, the interference with rear vision was a comment that a commenter made in the regulatory history and the agency never really expressed an opinion one way or the other about whether that was a concern. I think what's really important here is that state tort law provides an incentive for manufacturers to exercise their options reasonably. And whether that option is to exceed a minimum standard that doesn't have options, or to choose between two different options that a minimum standard provides, state tort law ensures that Type 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs. You have a jury with an injured plaintiff, they are not likely to weigh heavily the fact that this would cost 3 extra cents per car fleet wide. I think that is the sort of thing NHTSA considers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BUCHANAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, under any state's tort law, I think cost and feasibility would be practical considerations for the jury under the jury instructions given. Those are liability issues, cost and feasibility in any tort system. And so that's a liability issue down the road. Here it's important to preserve state tort law because Congress said state tort law shall be preserved. And again, whether it's a choice between options, Type 1 or Type 2, or whether it's potential liability for not going beyond the minimum braking standard, either way manufacturers should be held accountable according to Congress in its enactment of the statute for the design choices they make. There is nothing different about a design standard option 1 versus option 2. The final point I want to make before I sit down is that I think in some respects this case with regard to the question about whether Congress intended for the agency to be the exclusive authority for weighing these types of considerations, in some respects Wyeth versus Levine is instructive here. Because I think that was the same argument that was made in Wyeth versus Levine, that a jury should not be allowed to second-guess the FDA's labeling issues and to allow the jury to do so would subvert the exclusive authority of a Federal agency, and the Court rejected that argument in Wyeth, and as the dissent pointed out in Wyeth, that statute did not even have a Savings Clause. And it did not define the labeling standards as minimum standards. Here we have a much more clear expression of congressional intent. They intended these to be minimum standards. They have a savings clause that says common law liability shall be preserved. Obviously Congress did not intend NHTSA to be the exclusive safety standard cook. They deliberately preserved state court juries as also providing for additional vehicle safety and for an incentive to manufacture safer vehicles."
