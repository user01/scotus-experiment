The plaintiff's alternative only reduced the BVAP by 3 percent to 50 percent, and yet that converted District 2 with a brand­new Republican incumbent from a toss­up district to what plaintiffs themselves characterize as a heavily Democratic district.

But we are defendants appealing an adverse order. Defendants appealing an adverse order never argue that the adverse order violates their constitutional rights. They're arguing that it disrupts the status quo by changing the rules, and the status quo is what they are defending. This Court has made it clear repeatedly, in ASARCO, Swann, Electronic Fittings, that obviously, if the remedial order puts the defendants in a worse position than they were, they have a direct stake in the outcome of the appeal and they can appeal. If the rule were otherwise, Justice Ginsburg, no defendant could ever appeal an adverse order, because the adverse orders virtually never are alleged to violate their rights. So it's precisely the same sort of injury suffered by Representative Forbes as we ­­ would be suffered by an incumbent who lived in District 3. Let's assume the incumbent in District 3 had intervened, and they dropped the BVAP to 30 percent and made it a 60 percent Republican district. Is anyone arguing that that incumbent couldn't challenge the order that severely hampers his or her chances for re­election, the answer is clearly yes. Since Representative Forbes in the adjacent district has suffered precisely the same kind of injury, as I had hypothesized for the incumbent in District 3 by analogy to Hays, obviously he has standing to appeal."

Keene, and we read that as standing for the proposition that where an intervenor can argue injury to his election opportunity, that is adequate for a standing. And in this case, it's true: Congressman Forbes, the fact that he had to switch from CD4 to CD2 really does prove the injury. And the Special Master found that his district would go from 48 percent Democratic to 60 percent Democratic. I think that that suffices to prove the injury."

There isn't a ­­ a ­­ a cognizable interest among the voters or among the candidates in just seeing that a ­­ a lawfully legislated districting plan is enacted. Otherwise, I think every voter in the State would have standing, because the legislature said, you should be in this district, you should have a fair opportunity to vote. But that's not the direction the Court has gone. And I do think that the combination of ­­ viewing the office as, one, that the officeholder gets to choose the constituents, and the potentially broad impact of that is one that should give this Court some pause. And particularly ­­ again, just to pick up on what plaintiffs' ­­ plaintiffs' counsel, Mr. Elias, was saying ­­ I think, particularly in a situation where you have a State statute, in this Court's observation in Hollingsworth, it would be quite unusual, I think, to find standing here.

I wanted to start with the observations of Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan on the could­have, would­have standard that Mr. Carvin has ­­ has put forth, which, as I understand it, is basically, the district is okay even if based on race as long as it could have been drawn on the basis of politics or would have been. We think that really flies in the face of the Shaw and Miller line of cases, that what those cases are about at core are two principal things: That you can't use race as a proxy, and you can't sort voters on the basis of race. And when you do that, it is not a defense to say, well, I could have done the same thing on the basis of politics. You can send it back. If the legislature, in fact, does the same thing, taking race out of the equation, then fine. The injury that the Shaw line of cases was designed to get at is eliminated. It is precisely the sorting. And so I think the would­have or could­have test that Mr. Carvin has put forward is really quite at odds with ­­ with the ­­ with this Court's jurisprudence."

And in Alabama, this Court had a policy, and it didn't look to see whether each of the legislators individually had embraced that policy. That was something that the Court accepted. So I think there is a long line of case law going that way. And second, of course, it's not solely the intent of the drafter here. There are objective indicators, which this Court has indicated in both Shaw and Miller are extremely important, things the Court looks to ­­ the traditional redistricting factors, such as contiguity, compactness, are counties being split ­­ that reinforce that kind of intent.

That's what the district court said: Race, politics, and incumbency protection.

If you turn to 33a, why was politics and incumbency subordinate? They told you: Because that, quote, \"goal was permissive and subordinate to the mandatory criteria of compliance with the VRA.\" Now, they said that they implemented it by not reducing the benchmark BVAP, but that had nothing to do with the rank ordering of VRA over these other things.

    {
      "speaker": "CARVIN",
      "speech": "That's fine, and that goes to narrow tailoring, but what we are trying to figure out here is whether or not there is a prima facie case. Now, assume with me that in 30 of the districts in Alabama, race was completely coextensive. They didn't assert politics, but with county lines. Would you ever say that race predominated over something or subordinated something when they are entirely coextensive? Let's take it out of the racial context. Compactness is number two; county lines are number three. You draw a nice, compact district that complies with county lines. No one in their right mind would say \"compactness predominated over county lines\" because the same result was ordained by these two motives. And you can search this opinion for any finding that race was inconsistent with or subordinated incumbency protection or politics, and you won't find it. Therefore, they haven't made their basic burden of showing that traditional districting principles were subordinated nor their specific Cromartie II burden of showing it was subordinated to race rather than politics. The only evidence that they have even tried to come up with at the last minute is Joint Appendix 439. This is the VTDL analysis done by McDonald. It is undisputed that it has exactly the same flaws that this Court rejected as a matter of law in Cromartie II. Why? Because the racial effect is identical to the political effect. He made a big deal about the fact that there was a 16.5 percent gap between the VTDs in District 3 and those outside of District 3 in terms of race. But what his own index shows on JA 439 is there was also a 16 percent gap in Democratic percentages. So it's exactly the same flaw that was at issue in Cromartie II is here. So unless this Court is prepared to allow district courts to engage in naked defiance of the plain language and holding of Cromartie II, this case needs to be reversed. As to your direct evidence point, Justice Kagan, what was the direct evidence in Cromartie II? Partisan and racial balance. The Court said as clear as possible since he said partisanship and race, it says little or nothing about the relative predominance. What do we have here? Incumbency protection, politics and race. Therefore the direct evidence says little or nothing about the relative predominance. What you need to do is to show that they could have accomplished their legitimate political objectives in some other way. As to standing, I've heard the slogan repeated by all of my opponents, \"voters choose representatives not vice versa.\" That's a lovely slogan. But the relevant point here is that State legislatures choose which districts those voters go into, not the Federal judiciary. If, as you must assume, the Federal judiciary has exceeded its proper role and created a system which dramatically hurts the incumbents who were designed to be protected by this law, how can they not have a legally cognizable injury­in­fact?"
