      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the district court and then the court of appeals concluded that an additional 6 to 21 months in prison caused by counsel's deficient performance was not sufficiently significant to satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard. We believe the lower court's attempt to transform this Court's prejudice analysis under Strickland into a requirement that defendant show a significant increase in their term of imprisonment is misplaced. This Court should reject a significant prejudice test as inconsistent with Strickland and this Court's prior treatment of the prejudice test, as inconsistent with this Court's prior holding in Argesinger v. Hamlin that the right to counsel applies where any term of imprisonment is imposed, and because a significant prejudice test is unworkable and unfair. Also in this case, as Mr. Chief Justice has noted, the Government agrees with Glover on the basic issue that the Seventh Circuit's significant prejudice test is incorrect. The Government, however, raises a host of alternative grounds for affirmance in its brief on the merits. Because these new Government arguments were not raised by the Government in the court of appeals, not addressed by any lower court, not encompassed within the question presented in the petition for certiorari, and not persuasive even when examined on their own merits, this Court should not reach these new arguments, but should leave them to the lower courts to be addressed on remand."

      "speech": "Your Honor, I think the issues as to what arguments have been waived, what arguments -- by the Government or by Mr. Glover, whether to do a recalculation is something that would have to be sorted out by the Seventh Circuit, and I think that is one of the very reasons why remand to the lower court is appropriate in this case. In Strickland v. Washington, this Court established the prejudice prong for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. It stated that a defendant must show that but for counsel's unprofessional errors the results of the proceeding would have been different. In numerous decisions since Strickland, this Court has quoted and adhered to this difference in result language from Strickland. The court of appeals erroneously derived the significant prejudice test by misreading this Court's decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell. The circuit court misinterpreted Lockhart v. Fretwell as modifying the normal Strickland test by purportedly adding a new, more rigorous prejudice requirement. Last term, in Williams v. Taylor, this Court rejected the proposition that Lockhart has announced a new higher standard for showing prejudice. This Court in Williams reiterated that Strickland's difference-in-result test remained the standard to be applied in virtually all cases. Williams emphasized that, in its own words, a mere difference in outcome was sufficient to satisfy the prejudice prong. Here, Mr. Glover's counsel's ineffective performance led Mr. Glover to receive an additional 6 to 21 months in prison, clearly a difference in outcome. We also believe that this Court should be guided by its decision in Argesinger v. Hamlin. There, the Court held that any term of imprisonment, no matter how short, implicates the constitutional right to counsel. Consistent with Argesinger and its progeny, this Court should not tolerate 6 to 21 months of undeserved imprisonment caused by the ineffective performance of counsel. Furthermore, as the Government itself notes in its brief, a significant prejudice test is unworkable. One sees this problem in the decision of the district court below, where the district court struggled to figure out whether 6 to 21 months in prison was sufficiently significant. Although the court of appeals has employed the significant prejudice test for a number of years, it remains unclear whether the significant increase in sentence refers to some percentage change, some absolute number of months, or some other factor. For example, if significance is measured in offense levels, as some courts have stated, the two offense levels such as occurred in Mr. Glover's case, a two-offense-level change can be as much as 8 or 9 additional years in prison in some cases, depending on the crime and the characteristics of the offense."

      "speech": "Mr. Waldman, is your client still incarcerated? Does this case affect his actual incarceration?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALDMAN",
      "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. He has served approximately 5 years of his term, but he has another 13 months remaining, so a favorable result on a section 2255 motion would allow him to be released. We don't believe that one can seriously argue that 8 or 9 additional years imprisonment which are undeserved, and caused only by counsel's errors, can ever be considered insignificant. Moreover, we would make the more basic point, the point which we believe lies at the core of Argesinger, of Strickland, and the right to counsel cases, which is that any term of imprisonment which is undeserved and resulted from a lack of effective counsel cannot be permitted to stand. Turning to the new arguments in the Government's brief on the merits, although now agreeing with Mr. Glover that the lower courts erred in applying a significant prejudice test, the Government goes on on its brief on the merits to raise a variety of new grounds for affirmance. The Government argues that Mr. Glover's counsel did not perform deficiently at all. The Government now argues that the Wilson case requiring grouping offenses such as Mr. Glover's, that that case was wrongly decided by the court of appeals and should be overruled by this Court. Finally, the Government now argues that correctly recalculated under Wilson, in its view, Mr. Glover's sentence would actually be increased. However, these alternative grounds were not properly raised previously in this case, and should not be addressed by this Court in the first instance. First, these various Government arguments were never presented to the court of appeals. The Government argued only one issue in the court below, that 6 to 21 additional months in prison did not satisfy the significant prejudice test established by the Seventh Circuit, and we attach, in our -- as Appendix A to our reply brief, the Government's brief to the court of appeals."

    {
      "speaker": "WALDMAN",
      "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. Second, neither the district court nor the court of appeals ever addressed any of these various new Government arguments. The lower courts relied on only one ground, that petitioner could not satisfy the significant prejudice test of the Seventh Circuit. Third, these Government arguments are very different from the issue that we presented for review by this Court in our petition. The question presented by petitioner focused exclusively on the validity of the significant prejudice test which was relied on in the decisions below to dismiss Mr. Glover's petition. In these circumstances, this Court should not reach out to address the alternative grounds for affirmance now raised in the Government's brief on the merits. This rule's -- this Court's rules of procedure, as well as the numerous cases that we cite at pages 7 and 8 of our reply brief, make clear that the practice of this Court is not to address issues which appear for the first time in the merits brief to this Court. There are no extraordinary circumstances here which demand that this Court diverge from its usual practice. The Government's arguments do not raise pressing issues of constitutional significance, or issues of great national import. Rather, the Government's new arguments involve complicated and detailed applications of the sentencing guidelines and lower court procedures and decisions. These are precisely the types of issues which this Court should not be addressing. As this Court noted in Braxton v. United States, this Court should be, in its own words, restrained and circumspect in resolving sentencing guidelines interpretation issues, since Congress expressly provided the Sentencing Commission with the power to resolve issues involving conflicts in interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. Here in particular, the Sentencing Commission has announced that as one of its priorities this year it will be examining the guidelines interpretation of section 3(d)1.2, which is the very section which the Government is asking the Court to review. This Court will also occasionally resolve issues which were not raised below, where there is an obvious plain error which this Court can quickly and easily dispose of. That also is not the case here. As we demonstrate at pages 12 through 20 of our reply brief, not only are these issues not easily resolved, but the Government's new arguments at the end of the day are simply without merit. The Government argues that there was no deficient performance by Glover's counsel, yet Glover's counsel on appeal never raised the issue of grouping the kickback and money laundering offenses. The probation officer's report had recommended grouping, and at least three circuits had ruled in favor of such grouping. This was a pure legal issue. It was a strong viable claim that his appellate counsel should have raised, and which, as the Wilson case shows us, would have prevailed. This grouping issue was far superior to the two claims which were raised by Mr. Glover's counsel on appeal. These two claims involve challenges on evidentiary and fact-findings by the district judge where the standard of review required Glover's counsel to make his case by clear error. Ultimately the court of appeals found that these two claims raised by Glover's counsel were wholly unfounded, in its words, involved no error whatsoever, let alone clear error, and also again in the opinion it says it was not a -- these are not a close call. Comparing the grouping claim with those claims which he did assert, we submit that Glover's appellate counsel clearly acted outside the scope of a reasonably competent attorney in not raising this grouping issue on appeal. We also believe that it was clearly deficient performance to not bring the Wilson case, a -- the Seventh Circuit's new case which controlled this issue and was directly on point, to not bring it to the attention of the panel in Mr. Glover's case, even though that case was still pending when Wilson was decided. As to the Government's other elaborate challenges to the sentencing guidelines calculation, we believe that the Seventh Circuit's decisions in Wilson I and Wilson II are controlling and correct. The Government has offered no compelling justification for this Court to review these decisions, or to overrule their sound reasoning."

We presented that analysis on the prejudice prong of the case in order to illustrate how very complicated the guidelines decisions that counsel faces are when deciding whether to raise a particular claim or not to raise a particular claim. These are intricate matters that are quite complex in Federal criminal law, and more complex than most decisions that counsel has to make, and it is therefore highly relevant to what this Court says, if anything, about the proper analysis and performance when counsel is charged with having failed to raise a sentencing guidelines claim that the client later believes that he should have raised.

I could understand it if you were presenting to this Court some novel new theory of counsel inadequacy that we have to signal to the lower courts, but there's really nothing bizarre about the arguments you're making. They're standard adequacy-of-counsel arguments, aren't they, and can't we leave them to the Second -- Seventh Circuit to figure out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Well, I hope they're not bizarre, but I do think that the arguments that we've made have gone a little bit beyond what you, Justice Scalia, have just accurately described as where this Court has thus far gone in analyzing the performance inquiry. Clearly, counsel has to be selective in raising the issues that it chooses to present to an appellate court especially, and clearly, as this Court stated in Smith v. Robbins last term, just because a claim might look good in hindsight doesn't mean that it's the kind of claim that counsel should be deemed obligated to have raised. But there is a unique feature to the sentencing guidelines claims, as well as a generally relevant point to appellate advocacy that I think the Court could do well to clarify. In these sentencing guidelines claims, there can often be ambiguity about whether a particular claim will indeed help the defendant when it is raised on appeal and prevails and, if so, by how much. In this case, most starkly, our view is that if petitioner got the grouping that he asked for, his offense level should actually go up, not down, because the grouping would have required that all of the financial harm that he inflicted on the various victims be aggregated into one group, so a counsel who was looking at a sentencing guidelines claim, unlike claims that would simply result in a reversal of a conviction, has to be cognizant that there can be unintended adverse effects. In addition, and this was the insight that I think the Seventh Circuit was most concerned with, sentencing guidelines claims can produce sometimes only very modest benefits, and the length of the benefit that would be produced is a relevant factor in considering whether reasonable counsel would elect to raise a relatively long-shot claim, or a claim that's not established."

The inquiries here are essentially whether the defendant's lawyer did not present a claim that was sufficiently strong that it was ineffective for him not to present it.

I don't think that competent counsel is required to stay abreast of the law in that fashion. Second, as we have pointed out, competent counsel may well conclude that, rather than risking the ire of the court of appeals by raising a claim that he had previously abandoned and is now exploiting only because some other defendant had successfully raised it might cost him credibility with the court of appeals and is therefore not appropriately done.

      "speech": "I have spoken to the U.S. Attorney's Office about that question and I have not received a clear answer, because it doesn't come up all that often, but I will say that the Seventh Circuit is a procedurally strict circuit and it does make every effort to ensure that parties get review only on those issues that they've elected to raise in their opening brief. Now, there is one piece of stray dictum in a Seventh Circuit case that suggests that, of course, if the law changes, maybe parties can raise new issues. Other circuits are divided on that issue, so it's hardly something that I think competent counsel should be presumed required to do in order to meet the minimal constitutional standard of adequacy. And the final reason why in this case I don't think competent counsel was deficient even if he knew about Wilson and didn't raise it to the court of appeals is because Wilson, under its grouping analysis, produces this strange anomaly of requiring more financial harm to be included in each of the offenses that is grouped, and for reasons that as Justice Breyer has pointed out, very few people understand but we've attempted to lay out in our brief, the offense level would actually go up, and it would have a counterintuitive result. This actually happened in the Wilson case. The judge on remand from Wilson I, the case that petitioner says should have been cited to the panel, resentenced the defendant to a higher sentence, faithfully applying the guidelines as he understood them. The court of appeals then reversed, saying, well, the Government had waived its right to argue the increased offense level in that manner. We don't agree with the Seventh Circuit's waiver analysis, but the more salient point here is that no counsel could have foreseen that the Seventh Circuit would later apply a waiver analysis, and thus, if counsel had actually read the Seventh Circuit's decision and said grouping is required under subsection (d) of the sentencing guidelines, section 3(d)1.2, and had asked for that, the sentence could go up, and that lawyer would not be assured that there would be any purpose served by raising that kind of an argument only to his client's ultimate detriment. So taking into account the complexities of the guidelines, the potential for adverse results that can occur, and the state of the law which hardly suggested that this was, as Judge Easterbrook has called in another context, a dead-bang winner on appeal, we don't think that there was any deficient performance by petitioner's counsel that would merit ineffective assistance relief on collateral review. If the Court has no further questions --"

      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. I will be brief. The Government has said that it wants this Court to issue guidance. I wrote down, an advisory opinion would be useful to clarify some points. This Court has procedures as to when it will take cases in the first instance. It says that it will only do so in extraordinary, rare circumstances. This Court -- there are reasons for those procedures of this Court, and the cases that we cite at page 7 and 8 of our reply brief. This Court benefits from the thinking of the lower court. It benefits from the refinement and sharpening of issues by the lower courts. None of that occurred here, and the Government has not identified any issue that is so pressing, that is so -- such an issue of concern for the lower courts that guidance by this Court is essential. It hasn't reached that extraordinary circumstance requirement which this Court has set for dealing with issues at the first instance. There is nothing at core -- as Justice Scalia said, this is standard analysis. There is nothing unusual about these arguments being made by the Government here concerning the sentencing guidelines. They are complicated arguments. They are detailed arguments. They are arguments which are best sorted out by the lower courts here. As to whether the Seventh Circuit would accept the Wilson case if offered after briefing and oral argument, we cite a number of cases in footnote 14 indicating that we believe they would, but that's an issue which the Seventh Circuit is in the best situation to resolve, not this Court in the first instance. We would also note, again, this Court's decision in Braxton v. United States, that it should restrained and circumspect in dealing with sentencing guidelines issues. This sentencing guideline issue in particular is in front of the Sentencing Commission, and we don't see any reason for this Court to engage in advisory opinions or clarifying issues that have not been addressed and dealt with by the lower courts. Thank you, Your Honor."
