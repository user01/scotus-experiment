    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the district court and then the court of appeals concluded that an additional 6 to 21 months in prison caused by counsel's deficient performance was not sufficiently significant to satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard. We believe the lower court's attempt to transform this Court's prejudice analysis under Strickland into a requirement that defendant show a significant increase in their term of imprisonment is misplaced.  This Court should reject a significant prejudice test as inconsistent test is incorrect.  The Government, however, raises a host of alternative grounds for affirmance in its brief on the merits.  Because these new Government arguments were not raised by the Government in the court of appeals, not addressed by any lower court, not encompassed within the question presented in the petition for certiorari, and not persuasive even when examined on their own merits, this Court should not reach these new arguments, but should leave them to the lower courts to be addressed on remand."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would it also be open to the lower court on remand to reassess its initial position on Glover's leadership role if it knew what it knows now about the  -- that the Seventh Circuit's test is incorrect?  Could the sentencing court then say, but we didn't give extra points for leadership last time around, now we want to reassess that and give him the extra established the prejudice prong for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.  It stated that a defendant must show that but for counsel's unprofessional errors the results of the proceeding would have been different.  In numerous decisions since Strickland, this Court has quoted and adhered to this difference in result language from Strickland. The court of appeals erroneously derived the significant prejudice test by misreading this Court's decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell.  The circuit court misinterpreted Lockhart v. Fretwell as modifying the normal Strickland test by purportedly adding a new, more rigorous prejudice requirement.  Last term, in Williams v. Taylor, this Court rejected the proposition that Lockhart has announced a new higher standard for showing prejudice. This Court in Williams reiterated that Strickland's held that any term of imprisonment, no matter how short, implicates the constitutional right to counsel. Consistent with Argesinger and its progeny, this Court should not tolerate 6 to 21 months of undeserved imprisonment caused by the ineffective performance of counsel. Furthermore, as the Government itself notes in its brief, a significant prejudice test is unworkable. One sees this problem in the decision of the district court below, where the district court struggled to figure out whether 6 to 21 months in prison was sufficiently significant.  Although the court of appeals has employed the significant prejudice test for a number of years, it remains unclear whether the significant increase in sentence refers to some percentage change, some absolute number of months, or some other factor."

    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor.  He has served approximately 5 years of his term, but he has another 13 months remaining, so a favorable result on a section 2255 motion would allow him to be released. We don't believe that one can seriously argue that 8 or 9 additional years imprisonment which are undeserved, and caused only by counsel's errors, can ever be considered insignificant.  Moreover, we would make the more basic point, the point which we believe lies at the core of Argesinger, of Strickland, and the right to counsel cases, which is that any term of imprisonment which is undeserved and resulted from a lack of effective counsel cannot be permitted to stand. Turning to the new arguments in the Government's brief on the merits, although now agreeing with Mr. Glover that the lower courts erred in applying a significant Glover's sentence would actually be increased.  However, these alternative grounds were not properly raised previously in this case, and should not be addressed by this Court in the first instance.  First, these various Government arguments were never presented to the court of appeals.  The Government argued only one issue in the court below, that 6 to 21 additional months in prison did not satisfy the significant prejudice test established by the Seventh Circuit, and we attach, in our -- as Appendix A to our reply brief, the Government's brief to the court of appeals."

    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. Second, neither the district court nor the court of appeals ever addressed any of these various new Government arguments.  The lower courts relied on only one ground, that petitioner could not satisfy the significant prejudice test of the Seventh Circuit. Third, these Government arguments are very different from the issue that we presented for review by this Court in our petition.  The question presented by petitioner focused exclusively on the validity of the significant prejudice test which was relied on in the There are no extraordinary circumstances here which demand that this Court diverge from its usual practice.  The Government's arguments do not raise pressing issues of constitutional significance, or issues of great national import.  Rather, the Government's new arguments involve complicated and detailed applications of the sentencing guidelines and lower court procedures and decisions.  These are precisely the types of issues which this Court should not be addressing. As this Court noted in Braxton v. United States, this Court should be, in its own words, restrained and circumspect in resolving sentencing guidelines interpretation issues, since Congress expressly provided the Sentencing Commission with the power to resolve issues involving conflicts in interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. demonstrate at pages 12 through 20 of our reply brief, not only are these issues not easily resolved, but the Government's new arguments at the end of the day are simply without merit. The Government argues that there was no deficient performance by Glover's counsel, yet Glover's counsel on appeal never raised the issue of grouping the kickback and money laundering offenses.  The probation officer's report had recommended grouping, and at least three circuits had ruled in favor of such grouping. This was a pure legal issue.  It was a strong viable claim that his appellate counsel should have raised, and which, as the Wilson case shows us, would have prevailed.  This grouping issue was far superior to the two claims which were raised by Mr. Glover's counsel on appeal.  These two claims involve challenges on submit that Glover's appellate counsel clearly acted outside the scope of a reasonably competent attorney in not raising this grouping issue on appeal. We also believe that it was clearly deficient performance to not bring the Wilson case, a -- the Seventh Circuit's new case which controlled this issue and was directly on point, to not bring it to the attention of the panel in Mr. Glover's case, even though that case was still pending when Wilson was decided. As to the Government's other elaborate challenges to the sentencing guidelines calculation, we believe that the Seventh Circuit's decisions in Wilson I and Wilson II are controlling and correct.  The Government has offered no compelling justification for this Court to review these decisions, or to overrule their sound reasoning. review was whether 6 to 21 additional months in prison due to counsel's ineffective performance constitute prejudice under the Strickland test.  This Court's precedent and elemental fairness requires that this Court reject the significant prejudice test applied by the Court below. If the Court has no further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time."

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with petitioner that the Seventh Circuit erred in adopting a significant difference test for measuring the prejudice inquiry under Strickland v. Washington.  We believe, however, that the judgment in the rationale of the Seventh Circuit and, in fact, indicated that the Seventh Circuit might wish to reconsider it in light of this Court's intervening decision in Williams v. Taylor and a Fifth Circuit decision that had criticized it, but we had not formally concluded our analysis of whether at the end of the day we would or would not defend the approach that the Seventh Circuit adopted at the time we filed our response to the certiorari position. After we told the Court not to grant the case, and the Court disagreed and granted it, we then undertook a complete analytical review of the Seventh Circuit's approach and concluded that we could not submit that this Court could affirm that approach consistent with its own cases and principles governing the ineffective assistance analysis, but we continued to believe that the judgment in related to whether money laundering should be grouped with the underlying offense are both complicated and the kind of issue that this Court would ordinarily properly leave to the Sentencing Commission to resolve, particularly since the Sentencing Commission is aware of it. We presented that analysis on the prejudice prong of the case in order to illustrate how very complicated the guidelines decisions that counsel faces are when deciding whether to raise a particular claim or not to raise a particular claim.  These are intricate matters that are quite complex in Federal criminal law, and more complex than most decisions that counsel has to make, and it is therefore highly relevant to what this Court says, if anything, about the proper analysis and performance when counsel is charged with having failed to raise a sentencing guidelines claim that the client later confront counsel who is handling a sentence or a sentencing guidelines question on appeal, and that if it were the case that any guidelines error could support collateral relief, the defendant would often get the chance for two full bites at the apple at sentencing questions, first at trial and on direct appeal, and second on collateral review, and --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That may be, but it's hard to say that's what the Seventh Circuit was talking about.  They say Glover, to win on ineffective assistance he'd have to show his counsel performed below a constitutional threshold and that the deficient performance prejudiced him.  Even if we were to assume that Glover's attorneys performed inadequately, the second prong, prejudice, is missing here, and then they go on to discuss that, so it seems to me they didn't say one single word about was, there to confirm that you recognize the Second Circuit did not pass on the adequacy of the performance.  It said, we will assume, for purposes of this decision, that the performance was inadequate.  Even so, there was no prejudice. So we don't even have an answer in the first instance on the deficiency of the performance from the Seventh Circuit.  Why should we handle such a question as a matter of first view?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "I think, Justice Ginsburg, the reason why it is relevant for the Court to say something about the performance issue, which was not addressed squarely by the Seventh Circuit -- we did argue it in the district court and the district court didn't address it either, so it has not been resolved by the courts below, but it is highly interrelated with the prejudice inquiry hasn't resolved it, but this Court is going to announce a decision that will be influential in the way that the lower courts address comparable sentencing guidelines ineffective assistance of counsel cases, and I think that it would be useful for the lower courts to have some guidance from this Court as to some of the relevant considerations and factors that ought to be brought to bear on the performance inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There's really nothing novel about the points you make concerning adequacy of counsel's performance.  You say, you know, these are complex issues, you can't raise too many either at the trial level or especially on appeal, you have to pick your good targets, this wasn't a good target -- I mean, it's all standard analysis, it seems to me. I could understand it if you were presenting to just accurately described as where this Court has thus far gone in analyzing the performance inquiry. Clearly, counsel has to be selective in raising the issues that it chooses to present to an appellate court especially, and clearly, as this Court stated in Smith v. Robbins last term, just because a claim might look good in hindsight doesn't mean that it's the kind of claim that counsel should be deemed obligated to have raised. But there is a unique feature to the sentencing guidelines claims, as well as a generally relevant point to appellate advocacy that I think the Court could do well to clarify.  In these sentencing guidelines claims, there can often be ambiguity about whether a particular claim will indeed help the defendant when it is raised on appeal and prevails and, if so, by how much. In addition, and this was the insight that I think the Seventh Circuit was most concerned with, sentencing guidelines claims can produce sometimes only very modest benefits, and the length of the benefit that would be produced is a relevant factor in considering whether reasonable counsel would elect to raise a relatively long-shot claim, or a claim that's not established."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There's -- on occasion -- I -- it seems to me that case -- opinion perhaps represents a decision that a particular claim is logically antecedent to another one, and it seems to me you have a hard time saying that here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "I do have a hard time saying it's logically antecedent, but the third case that I would refer the Court to involves the elaboration of the additional implications of a claim that the court decided. That is Colstad v. American Dental Association, which was decided in 1999, and there the Court elaborated a standard for punitive damages in Title VII actions and then went on to give guidance to the lower courts about how agency principles apply, but then remanded -- could resolve these issues, and if this Court chooses to give the guidance that we think is appropriate, it will help the overall administration of the judicial system, because we believe, on the one hand, that when a defendant has not had adequate assistance of counsel, constitutionally effective assistance of counsel in litigating the sentencing guidelines claims, and he can show a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then he has satisfied the elements of a constitutional claim."

  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "No.  I actually would like the Court to say that the Seventh Circuit applied the incorrect test for prejudice, but a properly analyzed performance and prejudice inquiry would produce the conclusion that petitioner's counsel is wrong.  That would be my first choice. My second choice is for the Court to do no harm to the arguments that I'm making about ineffective counsel is retained or appointed.  The only place where there's a different standard is where counsel is waived altogether and the defendant represents himself.  He can then not charge himself with ineffective assistance of counsel. There is one legal point that has not been clarified in this Court's cases regarding appellate assistance by counsel that could also be usefully clarified, and that is that we think the proper inquiry would look to the state of the law facing appellate counsel, rather than having an evidentiary hearing that would analyze in great depth how much legal research the particular counsel did in anticipation of filing his appellate brief. The inquiries here are essentially whether the defendant's lawyer did not present a claim that was decision in Wilson came down, so that any competent counsel would have said to the Seventh Circuit, may I file a supplement including this decision, which bears very much on a case that is sub judica before you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Well, I think the answer is no, for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg.  First of all there's no authority that I know of that says that competent counsel is required to continue to survey the developing law on issues that he decided not to raise to appeal to an appellate court to determine whether there has been some change of law on an issue that he abandoned. I don't think that competent counsel is required to stay abreast of the law in that fashion. Second, as we have pointed out, competent counsel may well conclude that, rather than risking the ire of the court of appeals by raising a claim that he had practice is?  Does it generally receive such supplemental briefs based on intervening changes in the law?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "I have spoken to the U.S. Attorney's Office about that question and I have not received a clear answer, because it doesn't come up all that often, but I will say that the Seventh Circuit is a procedurally strict circuit and it does make every effort to ensure that parties get review only on those issues that they've elected to raise in their opening brief. Now, there is one piece of stray dictum in a Seventh Circuit case that suggests that, of course, if the law changes, maybe parties can raise new issues.  Other circuits are divided on that issue, so it's hardly something that I think competent counsel should be presumed required to do in order to meet the minimal constitutional standard of adequacy. would have a counterintuitive result. This actually happened in the Wilson case.  The judge on remand from Wilson I, the case that petitioner says should have been cited to the panel, resentenced the defendant to a higher sentence, faithfully applying the guidelines as he understood them.  The court of appeals then reversed, saying, well, the Government had waived its right to argue the increased offense level in that manner. We don't agree with the Seventh Circuit's waiver analysis, but the more salient point here is that no counsel could have foreseen that the Seventh Circuit would later apply a waiver analysis, and thus, if counsel had actually read the Seventh Circuit's decision and said grouping is required under subsection (d) of the sentencing guidelines, section 3(d)1.2, and had asked for that, the sentence could go up, and that lawyer would not counsel that would merit ineffective assistance relief on collateral review. If the Court has no further questions --"

    "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor.  I will be brief. The Government has said that it wants this Court to issue guidance.  I wrote down, an advisory opinion would be useful to clarify some points.  This Court has procedures as to when it will take cases in the first instance.  It says that it will only do so in extraordinary, rare circumstances. This Court -- there are reasons for those Court has set for dealing with issues at the first instance. There is nothing at core -- as Justice Scalia said, this is standard analysis.  There is nothing unusual about these arguments being made by the Government here concerning the sentencing guidelines.  They are complicated arguments.  They are detailed arguments.  They are arguments which are best sorted out by the lower courts here. As to whether the Seventh Circuit would accept the Wilson case if offered after briefing and oral argument, we cite a number of cases in footnote 14 indicating that we believe they would, but that's an issue which the Seventh Circuit is in the best situation to resolve, not this Court in the first instance. We would also note, again, this Court's decision Mr. Waldman.  The case is submitted."
