      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted ERISA, it created a Federal regulatory structure for employers and unions to sponsor plans that provide health care benefits for employees and their families. The vast majority of ERISA plans throughout the country have chosen to provide these benefits through HMO's or other managed care entities that use limited provider networks in order to deliver quality health care at a reasonable cost. The Kentucky laws before the Court today preclude that use of limited provider networks and require an HMO, and by using that term I mean to encompass a variety of managed care arrangements, require those arrangements to allow into the network any provider willing to accept the network terms. Because ERISA saves from preemption State laws which regulate insurance, the question here is whether these any willing provider, or AWP laws, regulate insurance."

He's getting something under a policy subject to the Connecticut law -- the Kentucky law, that he does not get under a policy without that law, and that is a breadth of choice about who is going to treat him."

They may not want the deal they've got, because they'll have less patient volume than they thought they were getting. It also adds significantly just administrative costs to deal with more providers, and it's also more difficult to monitor quality with a larger network, so it does have -- it's the uncertainty of what the law's effect will be that --"

Has that happened in States with any willing provider laws, that there are so many doctors who are coming in that the doctors who were in in the beginning now say, the rates have to go way, way up, because we don't have any guaranteed patient flow any more?"

If the Kentucky statute, the general any willing provider statute can be disaggregated into a bunch of separate statutes, each about a different provider, that the term, provider, includes podiatrists, physicians, optometrists, and pharmacists, so we have here effectively one part of the statute is an any willing pharmacy statute, that's functionally indistinguishable from the statute that was before the case in Royal Drug."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, considered by itself, if -- if you simply narrow to the provider subcategory of pharmacists, I -- I assume you're right, but if you look at the -- at the broad category that is covered by this statute, there is one, I think, significant difference between this and the -- and the limited pharmacy coverage in Royal Drug. I think the difference is this. Pharmacy coverage basically is -- is coverage for -- for benefits that are fungible regardless of where you get them. The super-aspirin, the industrial strength Motrin is going to be the same no matter what drug store you get it from. Medical coverage, however, is not. It is really important to patients to -- to choose a doctor because of the personal relationship, and therefore, I don't see the -- the precedential force of Royal Drug in -- in a physician coverage; a -- a physician option kind of case like this."

It's true the patient can't force a doctor to sign up with the HMO or force the HMO to take on a particular doctor, but in practical terms, there are going to be more doctors available under a Kentucky kind of regime, and in that sense, the patient is given a breadth of options that otherwise wouldn't be available. That seems to me to be important when one is selecting physician coverage in a way that is not important when one is selecting drug store coverage."

      "speaker": "ECCLES",

Presumably those numbers are indexed since 1979 now, and -- and greater, but it was of great interest to the insured whether the pharmacy was participating or not. It made a large cost difference, and yet the Court said it is not insurance in part because it was not affecting, was not integral to, was not changing the legal rights of the insured-insurer relationship."

We -- we still think besides the direct, factual parallel with the fact that Kentucky has an any willing pharmacy statute, that Royal Drug is still the correct analysis for -- it gives the correct analysis as to the McCarran-Ferguson factors really for two reasons. One is, that's what this Court has applied consistently in its Savings Clause case -- cases. It -- it -- this Court said in the first Savings Clause case, Metropolitan Life versus Massachusetts, that the Royal Drug analysis was directly relevant to the ERISA Savings Clause, so it has the virtue of familiarity and precedent, and the -- the standards, the McCarran factors make sense here. They're objective factors that give some content to the subjective test, the common sense test. But the -- the second piece of -- of the many attacks that have been made on the -- the relevance of Royal Drugs in the brief is, it -- it's argued in the brief that this Court in Fabe took a broader view, looked to a different clause of McCarran-Ferguson and said it's broader, that insurance regulation can be a little broader, and it's geared to protect the performance of the contract, and we don't shy away from that. The any willing provider laws have nothing to do with the performance of the HMO policy here. They just do not add to that policy at all. It's argued in the briefs through hypothetical examples that they are effectively Kentucky's regulation of HMO's, the adequacy of the networks and so on, and we are accused of wanting to undo all regulation of HMO's. That's not our position here. The line we would draw would preserve most of the State's regulation of HMO's, but these laws are not laws that are substantive regulation of insurance, the AWP laws. They are not adequacy laws. They are not continuity of care laws. Kentucky has laws like that on its books."

Now, just to go back slightly over what I just said, we are not here challenging the basic concept of State regulation of HMO's. Where we think the Court has drawn the line, and where we would urge that it continue to draw the line, is to say that a law regulates insurance if it affects risk-spreading, which this does not. The risk here is the risk of financial loss from needing medical care. ERISA actually has a helpful definition that makes that clear. The definition of an employee welfare benefit plan, which is the kind of plan we're dealing with here, is a plan that provides benefits for medical, surgical, or hospital care, or benefits in the event of sickness. That's the risk."

It's always considered, you know, whether the legal rights of the insured are being regulated here, are being protected by the State regulation in the insurer-insured relationship, and in that mandated benefit case, they're clearly getting a new legal right which they do not have under any willing provider."

These statutes simply prohibit insurers from arbitrarily limiting the number of providers that they contract with for the benefit of their insureds. These statutes allow insureds greater access to the health care provider of their choice, and I think this is -- is clearly seen in KRS 304-17A-505(1)(k), which requires the insurer to disclose that they are willing to contract with any willing provider.

What this law is, is a condition on the spreading of risk, the insurer is saying, we are going to spread the risk so long as you go to an in-network provider, and the State here is regulating that condition, and really it's analogous -- it has to do with the performance of the risk-spreading."

In the Fabe case, which involved the other part of McCarran-Ferguson, which saved State laws in the areas of traditional, in the area of traditional State regulation, it talks about regulating the business of insurance. In ERISA, you're now one step farther away, because now it just says, regulate insurance, and I think those laws are differently worded, and there's every reason to give them a somewhat different scope."

It talks about a regulation that homes in on the insurance industry, or is aimed at the insurance industry. It is relevant how the State codified it because, as the Court said in -- as recently as Rush, I think, the term insurance acquires its coloration and meaning from State law, State practice, and State usage, because what Congress was trying to do was preserve State law in an area of traditional State authority, and therefore, the codification in the Insurance Code is of relevance. And finally, at the very least, a State law that affects the contract between the insured and the insurer, which this one does, has a necessary effect on that contract and, in fact, a substantial one. That, although what is insurance may be broader than that, something that does satisfy that I think clearly is insurance under the -- the common sense --"

      "speech": "I'll address four points, if I may. First, as to the argument that a condition is removed in the policy by operation of Kentucky law, that's not true. Before and after the Kentucky law, the condition on getting payment from a -- from a participating physician is identical. All that's changed is that outside network. The law, just so I'm clear, does not, by itself, require a network to admit a chiropractor when it has no chiropractic coverage. That's a different law. If it did that, we would say that definitely affects the legal rights of the insured and would be a mandated benefit law such as the Court sustained. Second point, we are not -- a comment was made by counsel for the Commissioner about regulations of providers providing benefits to the insurers. Some do, and those -- the line we would draw, say, if it's a regulation of a provider such as a continuity of care, such as a hold harmless provision that prevents the provider from billing for the balance above the network rate, that clearly affects the legal rights of the insured, and would be saved under our test. Third, Royal Drug, it's this Court's precedents that have said the Royal Drug analysis is directly relevant to the ERISA Savings Clause. It was the dissent in Royal Drug who said that pharmacy agreement is integral to the relationship. You can't have it without -- you can't have the insurance without the pharmacy agreement, but that was said in the dissent. The Court rejected that view, and who is in the participating network is not part of the benefit of the insured. The insured just has no right to decide what doctor to go to, or any legal right. To address -- fourth and finally, to address perhaps more concisely the question of why do we care, if this isn't going to expand the networks, it's -- it hurts us even if the network doesn't expand in the slightest because if nothing changes, if no choices or options are expanded, the uncertainty that has resulted is added to the administrative cost. It's affected the ability to be selective. You have these networks --"
