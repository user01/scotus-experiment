The term houseboat is something that is self-propelled, generally moves people or things over water. What happened in the Sea Village Marina case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the wrong term. It cited a lot of cases that held that houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that is designed to move its owner and the owner's things from here to there, are vessels. And we don't dispute that. But on the other hand, you have something called floating homes, which the brief filed by the Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a very thorough description of what a floating home is and how it's different. And a primary way that it's different is that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its function, it's doing its job when it's moving things from place to place, a floating home can't function when it's out in the water being towed.

You seem to be suggesting a difference between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties to the concept of purpose.

In those kinds of cases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used for its function. It hasn't -- for example, if I could give a hypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of floating dock. Now, under their test, that would be a vessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with stuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that as a makeshift barge.

The only two times it moved any significant distance were: One, when it changed ownership; and two, when a hurricane struck, so it had to be moved. And look at your own cases. In Pavone, which this Court cited with approval in Stewart, that structure moved hundreds of miles over several years. This Court said not a vessel. The structure in Evansville moved three different ways. It moved up and down the Mississippi-Ohio River as it changed ownership several times over the course of 14 years. It also moved every winter to avoid the ice that would come in. And thirdly it was repositioned on literally almost a daily basis to accord with the stages of the river.

The importance of the connecting of the utilities and the water hose, which was actually a specialized water hose, not a garden hose, but the importance of those connections is found in State codes across the country that distinguish between floating homes and houseboats, asking whether they're dependent on those connections to operate. A floating home cannot function if it's not tied to land. It doesn't matter how many amps we want to fight about, it's whether it needs that power from land, whether it needs those connections to land.

But if ultimate mobility is part of the function of it, then -- then the answer could well be different.

At that time, many courts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot test, what is happening to this particular watercraft at the moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where the contract ensues, and the like. This Court subsequently disavowed the snapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was to describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not practically capable of movement or carriage because of their connections to the land. In Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat also owned the adjoining land and had control over the dock and built driveways so that trucks could come on and off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the houseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf boat, which are not typically attributes one would think of as ordinarily for vessels."

There was no admiralty basis there. He was still paying all of his dockage services and fees. It became an in rem action when the lien was not being discharged through his payment on the dockage fees, and the city had a basis under the wet slip agreement to assert a maritime lien, which is a classic admiralty action under Federal jurisdiction. So they are very different actions. Under the State court action he could still stay at the marina, but he had to be on a houseboat that complied with the marina's rules. He had two house boats at the marina, and this one was not in compliance, and that is why the city brought action against it. It was the only one of the 500-plus vessels and boats in this marina that wasn't in compliance with the rules."

No, it doesn't carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the figure which might move around; and then it does -- and Justice Kennedy said carrying goods. All right. Does this structure, this houseboat have a function of carrying goods? You're tempted to say yes, because his personal effects are in it.

And they have since stopped trying to be vessels because of state law changes that they were able to make. And so the question as a practical matter is are there physical impediments to the ability of that boat to -- to use the capability to move? The Star of India, which was referenced in the Belle of Orleans case, was not -- was a vessel, a sailing vessel from the 19th century. In 1926 they took it out of commission as a sailing vessel and they towed it to San Diego, where it sat for 50 years tied to the dock, and for the bicentennial, they decided let's get the boat out and sail it and they sailed it for the bicentennial. The Ninth Circuit held that's a vessel because it has the capability of being used as a vessel. And the fact that something is moored for a long time, if it has the physical attributes to be a vessel, it is a vessel. The United States -- the USS Constitution, the famous USS Constitution would be shocked to have heard Mr. Gannon's statement about vessel because there are 200 Navy service members who service the USS Constitution and take it out periodically for sail."

      "speaker": "FREDERICK",
      "speech": "No. But no -- and in fact, I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a different test that this Court last discussed in the Chandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to the mission of the vessel. And that -- I think that the Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside, because they bring in an entirely different regime that focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as opposed to the definition of vessel itself. The definition of vessel itself here is, as Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act, and it is something that does apply more broadly. But as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions that take that definition and then they add an intent requirement as specific language in different parts. So that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is something that is germane to that particular statutory function, than that is a question that becomes a question for jurisdiction. But I'd also like to point out that both, I think, the district court and the court of appeals here assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there had not been evidence that contested the basic principles that the City brought when it profiled this in rem action. And because the case then moved into the merits phase, the district judge here initially denied the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without prejudice. And then as the evidence came in, revisited the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in record evidence that affected the practical capability of the test. The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the court of appeals as a reason for error was that because he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he had no contractual or property right to do so, and he had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3 days' notice, the question of whether or not there was any record of evidence on practical capability got to the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in applying a practical capability test, said the things that Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record evidence. So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did do its job here is an important facet of the case as it comes. They initially asked you in the cert petition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test. They've not defended that test. And it is abjectly erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so easily manipulated by an individual's intent. And now by trying to morph it into some kind of function or objective purpose standard, they've essentially done exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered no evidence in the district court to try to prove. If there are no further questions."

      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "speech": "Thank you. I think Mr. Frederick's best argument that I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it carried his personal effects. The difficulty is that argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases. And I would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this Court reading and applying those cases. In Evansville, this Court dealt with something that carried around the effects of a business office. In Roper, this Court dealt with something that carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the structure in this case. Both instances, the Court said they're not vessels because the function was not to carry those things around, it was merely -- they were merely incidental relocations. Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that function is irrelevant. And the City can't be right on its test either. The only way the City has proposed to deal with those cases is to look at how securely the structure is fashioned. And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. If you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes. And not only that, if you want something that's utterly manipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's out of maritime jurisdiction. So this Court's cases for almost a century have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to apply. And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on those understandings. And it's not just the questions we've been talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the rest are built on this test. And we're asking this Court simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past. So I think that leaves the question of, when you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate or do you send -- or do you simply reverse? And we think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply reverse. You have everything in the record you need, most notably in the surveyor's report. And you can look at four things. Look at the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the structure, its equipment and the utilities. The materials used were plywood and ordinary land-based structures."

This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches under the water, is not meant to be moved around. Look at the -- look at its features. It has French doors on three sides a few feet above the water line. That's not what a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed. And finally, its utilities. Again, at Joint Appendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no batteries. It is utterly dependent on being hooked up to land. That's the only way it can function. So if this Court does nothing else between now and casting its vote and writing its opinion, revisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule that this Court has always applied."
