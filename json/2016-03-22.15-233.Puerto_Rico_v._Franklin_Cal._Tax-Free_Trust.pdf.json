      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question whether Congress has stripped Puerto Rico of access to any legal mechanism to restructure the debts of its public utilities which provide essential services to its citizens, like electricity and water. Respondents contend that Congress denied Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 altogether, but left Puerto Rico subject to Chapter 9's preemption provision. That anomalous result can't be squared with the statute's text and structure. Congress, in 1984, defined the word \"State\" in the Bankruptcy Code generally to include Puerto Rico, except for the purposes of determining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9. But that's just another way of saying that Puerto Rico's outside the scope of Chapter 9. A State's only role in the Chapter 9 regime is to authorize its municipalities to be debtors. Indeed, Chapter 9 can't apply to Puerto Rico in light of the 1984 amendment. That amendment categorically precludes Puerto Rico from passing through the gateway into Chapter 9, which is located in Chapter 1 in Section 109(c)(2)."

So either side here is going to be limited to speculation on that score. The one thing that we do know for sure is that the mere exclusion of an entity from Chapter 9 is not typically deemed to be a representation of intent by Congress to preclude a State law. And to answer your question more directly ­­ again, I am admitting this is speculation just as their position is speculation ­­ one thing that Congress could have been wanting to do is to put Puerto Rico and D.C. in the same boat for Chapter 9 purposes as Guam and the Virgin Islands, the other Territories that are not even within the definition of \"State\" in the Bankruptcy Code in the first place. In other words, two somewhat unusual things happened in ­­ when this provision was added. And again, to go back to your question, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, this came about after 1978 when the definition of \"State\" that had been in the Bankruptcy Code going all the way back to 1898 fell out of the Code. That definition broadly defined \"State\" to include Territories and possessions. In 1978, there was an overhaul of the Bankruptcy Code, and there was no definition of \"State.\" I think Congress recognized pretty quickly, as early as 1979. There were amendments to fix that omission of the Bankruptcy Code. And the initial ­­ the initial fix that was proposed by Senator DeConcini in 1979 went back to the old definition. It says, \"All Territories and States are included\" and had no exclusion. Okay, then. In 1981, though, a ­­ a new definition was ­­ that didn't go anywhere.

So in other words, if Congress were to have said Puerto Rico is not a State for purposes of Chapter 9, that would actually not solve the problem at issue here, because the authorization, the gateway provision into Chapter 9, is not in Chapter 9.

So for Congress to say \"except for Chapter 9,\" it actually would not have reached that 109 provision. The way to close the gateway was to say Puerto Rico is not a State for purposes of authorizing its municipalities to be debtors under Chapter 9. That closes the door, which is not located in Chapter 9. Once you close that door, then you don't reach ­­ chapter ­­ the provisions of Chapter 9 on which they rely and base their entire case don't come into play, because their whole argument is based on subsection 9031. 9031 is a proviso to 903. If you look ­­ and these now are within Chapter 9, as opposed to 109(c)(2), the gateway provision, which is not in Chapter 9. If you look at Chapter 1 ­­ excuse me ­­ Section 903, it says, \"This chapter\" ­­ i.e., Chapter 9 ­­ \"shall not limit or impair the power of a State.\" If a State ­­ or if a jurisdiction like Puerto Rico is categorically barred by Congress from authorizing its municipalities to enter into Chapter 9, then that reservation of power makes no sense. It ­­ it has no conceivable applicability to Puerto Rico. And so therefore, the 101 ­­ 9031 proviso, which refers back to \"such municipality\" in 903, doesn't work either. In essence, Your Honor, Respondents are asking you to look at that proviso in 9031 in isolation, as opposed to understanding how there is a decision tree here. Basically, the statutory definition in 101(52) sends you to 109(c)(2), which is in Chapter 1, and then that's the gateway provision. And that says that Puerto Rico, we know, is not a State for purposes of authorizing its municipalities to enter into Chapter 9. Once you understand that that gateway is categorically closed to Puerto Rico, unlike any of the States of the union, then 903, which is the next step in the decision tree, makes no sense as ­­ as it purportedly applied to Puerto Rico, because what 903 says is, \"This chapter shall not limit or impair the power of a State to control its municipalities.\""

Now, he wants us to read that as if there were then a parentheses, \"a State that is a debtor under Chapter 9.\" You see? And that a State ­­ what States? The States that can be debtors under Chapter 9. Now, that's how he wants us to read it, and that means that that provision does not apply to Puerto Rico or D.C.

It is that if you look at the first sentence of 903, is that what it says is that those States that are referred to in that first sentence maintain all the power to control by legislation or otherwise a municipality. And he says, what could that apply to? Those entities that are not in Chapter 9 obviously have all the powers they normally had, but the ones that are in Chapter 9 might not. And so what this Section 903 is addressed to are those States that are in Chapter 9, because there's no need to apply that first sentence to anyone else, and therefore it doesn't apply to Puerto Rico, that first sentence.

      "speech": "There are a few reasons, I think. And as Mr. Landau has said, there is no legislative history that sets this forth in detail, but let me suggest a few reasons why Congress might have done what it did. First, Congress has for a long time micromanaged Puerto Rico's debt. In the Jones Act, it specifically limited the amount of debt Puerto Rico could take on. That actually was kept and retained through the Public Law 600. And it was only in 1961 that Congress ended its own restriction of Puerto Rico's debt on the condition that the Puerto Rico ­­ Puerto Rico include that restriction in its own constitution. So there's a long history of Congress intervening on Puerto Rico debt issues. Second, Puerto Rico debt is uniquely triple tax exempt. Congress has essentially told the nation that ­­ and encouraged the nation all over to buy this debt. So there is a ­­ this is ­­ this debt, even more so than the average municipal bond, is widely disbursed throughout the nation. I think the ­­ third reason is that by 1984 Puerto Rico and D.C. are the two most indebted Territories by a lot. Puerto Rico already had $9 billion of debt. The District owed 1.6 billion, and it was about to hit the general obligation bond market for the first time in its history. So the question I ­­ I ask is, how would Congress, at that moment in time, actually think that this was the right time to abandon a 40­year­old policy of uniformity and preemption in the field of municipal bankruptcy, and ­­ and for the first time since 1946, allow the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to write their own municipal­bankruptcy laws that may or may not treat their nationwide creditors fairly, that may or may not result in ­­ in decrees that are enforceable nationwide? There's no good reason or plausible reason to think that Congress actually intended that result. And under this Court's cases in Timbers of Inwood and Cohen v. de la Cruz, when there is no clear indication in the statutory text, no indication in the legislative history ­­"

And you ­­ you go with the gateway provision, and then even if not all of Chapter 9 follows in its wake, at least all the provisions in Chapter 9 that refer to debtors follow in its wake. And Justice Breyer said, what's wrong with that, as a way to read this text. And then you answered him, I think this is fair to say, by giving a ­­ a story about what Congress meant to do in 903(1) in the wake of Faitoute. But, you know, both of you have stories about this, and it's not ­­ just not clear which of you is right. And I guess what I most want to think about is this text. Why isn't Justice Breyer's, Mr. Landau's view of the text just as good, if not better, than yours? And I didn't come in here thinking that, but now I kind of am thinking that.

So they ­­ they are in the same boat, those municipalities, as San Juan. There is no textual distinction to be drawn from those municipalities under 109(c)(2).

They didn't want those States who weren't in Chapter 9. They didn't want those States who were not in Chapter 9. They didn't want them to make rules for bankruptcy of municipalities, not binding rules, anyway. That was their purpose.

    {
      "speaker": "LANDAU",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Very quickly, I'd like to make three basic points. First, I think we've seen an example of selective textualism this morning. For their ­­ for Respondents' argument to make any sense with respect to the various Territories, they have to say that these other Territories, such as the Virgin Islands and Guam, are encompassed within the definition of the word \"State.\" They just can't say that when Congress, which had long­defined \"State\" to include all the possessions and Territories, in 1984, in the very provision that we are considering, said \"State\" includes Puerto Rico and D.C. That is probably the clearest expressio unius one can imagine. So for them to be saying that, well, even though it said Puerto Rico and D.C., it meant to include everything ­­ and again, Guam, for instance, and the Virgin Islands, have also Triple A tax­exempt bonds. So everything that is true for Puerto Rico would be true of the Virgin Islands and ­­ and Guam. I guess the more fundamental point, though, is when ­­ when you are asking them about how this ­­ their argument is, if you accept our position, then any municipality that is not authorized to file under Chapter 9 is also exempt from Chapter 9. They're trying to talk about municipalities. But I think, as Justice Ginsburg made the point, no, here we're talking about States. Massachusetts, for instance, always has the power to authorize its municipalities to seek Chapter 9 relief. The door is open for Massachusetts, and ­­ as it was for Michigan when Michigan, on the same day, authorized Detroit to file for bankruptcy, and Detroit in fact filed for bankruptcy. So the States that haven't yet authorized just maybe haven't had a crisis that requires them to do that. But they are trying to say you have to compare San Juan to Boston. Our point is, the relevant comparison, since we're talking about the word \"State,\" is you have to compare Puerto Rico to Massachusetts or Michigan. Unlike Massachusetts or Michigan, which have the door ­­ excuse me ­­ the key to the doorway, to the gateway in 109(c)(2), Puerto Rico categorically does not. Thus, when you arrive at 903 ­­ and the word \"State\" appears only three times in all of Chapter 9. It appears twice in ­­ in Section 903, which is reaffirming, saying this chapter, Chapter 9, does not limit or impair the power of States to control their municipalities. So that makes no sense as applied to jurisdictions like Puerto Rico that are categorically excluded from coming through the gateway of 109(c)(2), whereas it does make sense to apply that to the Massachusettses of the world, regardless of whether to date they have authorized their municipalities. Finally, the last point I'd like to make is, we've talked a lot about ­­ about legal principles, as is appropriate, today. But this is also a flesh­and­blood situation in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico enacted this Recovery Act because it is facing a crisis in providing essential services to its citizens. It is implausible at best to think that Congress left ­­ by taking Puerto Rico out of Chapter 9, meant to ­­ and that's all we knew. It took Puerto Rico out of Chapter 9. To say that that precludes Puerto Rico from dealing in any way with the financial crisis for its public utilities, which in this ­­ for its public utilities, which provide basic services like electricity and water to its people ­­ that's the question: Whether people in a village in Puerto Rico will be able to get clean water. That ­­ this is something ­­ again, it's fine to talk about the generalities of the law, but when you're trying to think about congressional intent, please don't lose sight of the fact ­­ of the fundamental implausibility and the anomaly of saying, when Congress took Puerto Rico out of Chapter 9, that it meant to leave that Chapter 9 preemption provision in place, and thus leave Puerto Rico in the dire situation that led the Commonwealth to use its police powers to enact this Recovery Act in the first place. Thank you."
