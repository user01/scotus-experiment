In this Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue a class of more than 3300 employees who occupied job ­­ more than 400 jobs which required widely differing amounts of time to perform their donning, doffing, and washing tasks."

Clemens and said those can be disregarded as mere trifles, we're allowed to do that. And the effect of what we, in fact, did hear was to round up in order to provide more time to people than they might otherwise have gotten.

So when those monies get allocated, ordinarily a district judge is going to do so on a basis either of pro rata for all of those ­­ all of those plaintiffs who were found to be injured, and the 212 who were identified by name, by Dr. Fox, Tyson knew about them before trial, did not move for summary judgment as to those 212, could have easily severed them right out before this case went to the jury. The second way is that Dr. Fox did an analysis using Mericle's averages and then added them to the number of minutes worked by the particular employee, and so based on that, a vast number got above the 40­hour threshold. Now, the evidence at trial that it came in by Tyson's own witnesses was that the average worker worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which would be a 6­day work week. And so the evidence as the jury was considering it found the vast majority of the class members were already going to be in overtime status, and that's why the fulcrum of the case came down to whether putting on this gear, which was standard sanitary gear for every single worker in the class, was compensable or not.

Because the time clustered around the average; that was his testimony. And that if you took into account the fact that they might be doing it in different places, you then see why averaging works. And the reason averaging works is because the workers were rotating among different assignments. Some of them might start the day in a non­knife capacity, and so putting on all the protective gear before they started their shift didn't make sense. They would carry it to the production line. They would be pulled off the production line, told you're going to be in a knife capacity, get your gear on. They would put their gear on at that time. So when Dr. Mericle is observing in the locker room how long it takes for people to put their gear on and take it off, he's not counting, he's not ­­ he's not counting ­­ he's not taking into account the variations in the work style mandated by the company."

The government thinks it's the standard that the jury was instructed on, and this appears at JA 471 to 472. The jury was told in this case that they could only rely on representative evidence if all of the employees performed substantially similar activities, and that substantial similarity is what we think is the proper standard to determine whether an inference here would be just and reasonable."

The fact that the jury did not give you the damages sought seems to me to call into question the significance of the statistics."

      "speaker": "PRELOGAR",

So I think we have to infer that the jury found that all of these activities were similar, that there were not material differences of the kind that Mr. Phillips has referred to today, because the jury was instructed that that was the only way they could award class­wide ­­ find a ­­ a finding here of class­wide liability."

And at the end of the jury instruction on representative evidence, which was an instruction that Tyson requested, the jury was told, quote, \"The representative evidence, as a whole, must demonstrate that the class is entitled to recover. And I think that there was an ample evidentiary basis here for the jury to conclude that there weren't substantial ­­ substantial dissimilarity among the tasks that were being performed in these donning and doffing activities. It's useful, I think, to review that record evidence. For example, Dr. Mericle testified that the times clustered around the averages. He had 744 videotaped observations. As well, there was the testimony that employees frequently rotated between positions, including between those jobs that used a knife and those that didn't. The employees who testified at trial had times that came in very close to Dr. Mericle's averages. And I'll just refer you to Mr. Logan, who testified at JA 260 and 265, 17 to 19 minutes. Mr. Bulbaris said 18 to 22 minutes. Mr. Montes said around 20 minutes. As well, Tyson itself didn't think that there were these material variations when it was calculating the K­Code time using a study that was very similar to the study that Dr. Mericle employed here and used essentially the same methodology. In that circumstance, Tyson thought that it would be appropriate to treat all employees in a uniform way.

It might signal that the work being performed on the job was somewhat different and required different levels of skill. But I think it's clear, based on the jury verdict in this case, the plaintiffs were able to prove their claim with class­wide evidence. And at this juncture, it's something of the reverse of what this Court has confronted in other cases, where the Court has recognized that sometimes the certification decision overlaps with the merits of the claim, and you have to consider at the outset whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their claim with class­wide proof."

Clemens said that when the recordkeeping violation prevents a determination of the amount of time spent on these activities, then you should be able to come forward with a just and reasonable inference and not put the burden on the employees to prove that time with precision. And when that exact same fact is relevant liability insofar as it's necessary to prove that the employee is pushed over the 40­hour­per­week threshold, then we think that all of the rationales that animated Mt. Clemens would equally apply to the determination of that particular fact in that context. But we think the Mt. Clemens itself signaled that this might be an appropriate determination at the liability phase because it recognized at the outset that the burden of proving that you have performed work for which you were not properly compensated shouldn't be an impossible burden. That was the language that was used in the opinion. And so I think that whether or not Mt.

They don't reveal some defect in that mechanism. There were any number of ways to account for this problem. The trial could have been bifurcated between liability and damages, as Justice Kagan noted. That would have solved this problem entirely, but Tyson opposed it. Or Tyson could have sought judgment against the 212 class members who had no right to recover under the plaintiffs' evidence. It didn't do that. Tyson could have asked for a special verdict that would have allocated the damages by the jury; but instead, it asked for a lump sum verdict. Or it could have asked for the class definition to be altered in this case to exclude those individuals who weren't working the requisite number of times.

      "speech": "Right. But my point here is, is that in general, everybody agrees that's a reasonable way to proceed. That's my point. Here we're not talking about homogenized because there are vast differences, and the evidence is absolutely unsalable on that. And with respect to Mt. Clemens, in the first place, I ­­ I don't think Mt. Clemens should be extended to ­­ to make the fair and reasonable inference standard of the presumption apply at the liability phase, and I think the court was extremely clear in not wanting to go down that path. But second, even if you thought the presumption should be applied here, I would argue that the Mericle's evidence, as ­­ as, you know, through cross­examination and examination of others, demonstrates that this is not a fair and reasonable inference. And on that score, it seems to me that there are two quotations I would offer up. One comes from this Court's decision in Wal­Mart, \"when an expert's testimony does nothing to advance a party's case, the Court can safely disregard what he says.\" And then what Judge Posner said in a very similar FLSA case, \"What cannot support an inference about the work time of thousands of employees is evidence of a small, unrepresentative sample of them,\" and that is precisely what we have in this particular case. With respect to remand, we would be happy for a remand to ­­ for allocation if that's permissible, but as I read, the final judgment of the district court is judgment of about $6 million to these named plaintiffs, and that was affirmed. There is nothing in there about how this is going to be allocated under these circumstances. So if the Court believes there's got to be a separate proceeding of allocation, the Court hopefully would order that, although I think there is a more fundamental decision the Court would have to reach. And then finally, with respect to who has the burden of dealing with this problem, it is the plaintiffs' burden to sustain the justification for a class all throughout the proceedings until a final judgment is entered. And we came to the court four times asking them not to certify this. So to come back in at the end and say, well, since we were able to try this without any ability to put forward any of our individual defenses with respect to any of these individual employees, except for the four who actually testified, is exactly what this Court said in Wal­Mart and Comcast is an impermissible way to define the class. The Court should reverse in this case, declare the class decertified. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, thank you."
