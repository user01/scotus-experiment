In our view, the plain language of the statute provides a clear answer to that question. All five of the statutory provisions that are directly applicable to this case base the tax on, quote, the wages paid during the calendar year, not the wages that should have been paid, or would have been paid, or could have been paid if events had been other than they were."

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "I actually think that there's no problem at all. In the first place I'd point out that that's the way it's been -- the Internal Revenue Service since the time of Nierotko has taken the position that the wages-paid rule is a statutory test for taxes. On the other hand, the Social Security Administration has taken the view that at least for statutory back pay, which wouldn't apply to this case, but at least for statutory back pay they will allocate it back, and that's been going on for 60 years, and it hasn't caused an enormous problem. In fact, it's caused no problem at all. As far as the specific -- I mean, I could go through some of the specific examples of problems that respondents say would be caused in the statute by their view. For example, there is a -- an exclusion from wages for money that's paid to somebody more than six -- on disability, for disability more than 6 months after the person -- the employee stopped working for the employer. Well, I don't see any problem that is created by applying the wages paid for taxes to that payment. In fact, the problem would be created quite the contrary. Under the wages-paid rule, you look, you count 6 months after the employee stopped working, which is what Congress wanted to do. Payments made after that date are not taxed. Payments made before that date are taxed. Under respondent's view, you'd have to take all the payments that were made after that date and try to figure out whether they should have been paid, should they have been paid earlier or should they have been paid later."

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "Well, not quite. The Social Security -- the issue arises, I would say, with less intensity and frequency in Social Security for a number of reasons. One is that as a Social Security -- under the Social Security scheme, they essentially permit you either -- your choice, option of either going back or using the wages-paid rule, and therefore a lot of cases, since you have a choice a lot of cases don't even arise, because they just use the wages-paid rule. Secondly, under the Social Security scheme, because of the way that works, it's a lot less significant, the allocation decision. Under Social Security, all you need is 40 quarters of coverage in order to be a fully-insured individual, and most people already have that, and it doesn't really matter whether it's in the quarter that it would be paid or the quarter, or some other quarter it's allocated to. In addition, under the Social Security scheme, your benefits are based essentially on your average annual earnings. That's the way they're currently calculated. It's just an average annual earnings. It doesn't really matter where you allocate the wages, it won't make much difference for most people's Social Security, because you're taking an average anyhow over some many-year period of time, usually. Now, I'm not saying it will never make a difference, but the issue arises much less sharply and with much less frequency in the Social Security context, but in any event --"

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",

It says, wages paid during the particular year, and I think that that ends the question as far as FICA and FUTA goes. The Court in Nierotko adopted a different construction of somewhat different language in the Social Security Act. I think the fairest reading of Nierotko is probably that the Court felt that this was not -- didn't tie it to any particular -- the allocation question -- didbn't tie to any particular language, but just decided that an exception of this sort was necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Social Security Act."

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "No, we don't. It was a statutory decision, and I don't think that there's any basis to overrule it. I think that they -- the Court didn't give any explanation of how it arrived at the conclusion that you have to allocate back based on any particular language of the statute, and that's one reason why I think the best reading of Nierotko is that the Court was just adopting a kind of extrastatutory exception, and saying, given the purposes of the Social Security Act and providing security for people so that they'll know they'll get the funds and won't descend into poverty as they get older, given those purposes, this is really the only way to do it for those purposes. The Court did not look at the specific language of the statutes here, or the specific changes that those statutes had gone through to arrive at that language. Originally in 1935, in the 1935 Act, the FICA, what became FICA and FUTA -- it was actually all part of the Social Security Act -- those taxes were based on wages paid for employment during a year. That meant, and everybody agreed at that time, you had to look at when the employment occurred, not when the wages were paid. That scheme was in effect for a few years and the 1939 Congress saw that it caused confusion and difficulties and said, we have to change this, because we don't want to have to -- it's easy to figure out when somebody was paid. Indeed, in this case they stipulated that they were paid in March of 1994 and usually that's a question that doesn't cause any problem, so we're going to base the taxes in 1939 on the wages paid. Now, in 1946, Congress extended that to the wage-base provision, so by 1946 everything was in line to avoid the kind of confusions and uncertainty that were caused by having to look and see when the employment was performed."

They said, 6 months after the employee ceased working, if it comes after, more than 6 months it's not taxed, if it's less than 6 months it is taxed. Their -- and really that's very consistent with the whole FICA and FUTA schemes, where these taxes are not generally as high as the income tax, and the FUTA tax is rather low.

Is that your answer?"
    },

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "I think, two answers. One is it has been true for 40 or 50 years, and it hasn't caused any major problems, but second is, I just don't think that there are anomalies, the anomalies would be created. Let me take another example. There's the example of a case where payments that are made to the estate of someone who's deceased in the year after they died, are not taxed under FICA and FUTA, but if the payment is made during the year -- in the same year that they died, they are taxed under FICA and FUTA. That provides a bright line. It's easy to administer. You go, you look, you see when the payment was made, and you decide whether you have to pay the FICA and FUTA taxes, which is very consistent with how Congress wanted this scheme to work. Under respondent's scheme, you have to look at all the payments that were made after the year that the person died and try to see, well, was there some reason why they really should have been made earlier, were they late, were they delayed, did the employer not make the payment on time, was there a dispute, whatever, and you have to sort all that out. I think under the logic of respondent's position, which is, you're trying to put people, the Federal Government in the FICA and FUTA system is trying to put people in the same position they would have been if the taxes had been paid when they should have been, you have exactly the reverse problem, too. All the payments that were made during the year that the person died, you have to look, well, were those advance payments, should they really have been made in the next year, why shouldn't they be made in the next year, then they're not taxable, and I don't really see any way to distinguish between any of those cases. I think Congress enacted a precisely drawn statute here with carefully drawn provisions that drew sharp lines and were easy to administer, and the wages-paid rule is the classic example of that, because it's -- there's very few disputes about when wages are actually paid, and if it's applied in accordance with its terms, then the result is that you were able to do it, and I don't think any --"

The -- I would add that the provisions at issue in Nierotko at most -- the Court in Nierotko did not discuss or cite any of the tax provisions at issue here. At the very most, they referred to section 209(g) of the 1939 Act, which had slightly different language from the tax provisions that are in issue here, although I wouldn't make a big deal out of that. It talked about quarters in which wages were paid, rather than wages paid during a year, but it had slightly different language, and I think the Court's whole approach in Nierotko was driven by its impression of the purposes, the need for security in an old age security system, which is what the Social Security system was. It would be anomalous to take that approach, that was driven by the purposes of that system and was, insofar as the Court was looking at language at all was driven by language of different provisions that are in a context that's talking about benefits determinations and who's a fully-qualified individual, and apply it to the statutes that are at issue here, which talk about rates of taxation, and are quite clear in speaking in terms of wages paid during a particular year. I'd just -- finally I'd add that the Treasury Department by regulation has for a very long time, since the time of Nierotko, and in fact even before that, looking at some of the wages, the rate provisions of the 19 -- when they were changed in 1939 has had a wages-paid rule. It's firmly adhered to that position. The Treasury regulations give examples of, right in the regulations of cases where some one is paid one year for services in the prior year, and they say no, you go, you look at when the pages were paid, and that answers all questions. It doesn't say, you then look and see well, when should they really have been paid, or why were they paid late, or should they have been paid later than they were, or any of those questions that could arise. The IRS, the Treasury regulations also speak specifically in terms of wages actually paid. That's the basis of the statute. I don't think that could be clearer, although I think actually the language of the statute is equally clear and consistent with that."

They have to deal with the -- deal with these kinds of problems on a daily basis."

The IRS, when they publish revenue rulings, says these don't have the full breadth of scope, because they generally deal with just a narrow issue, and they don't intend that they apply broadly to items beyond specifically the problem that they're addressing, but within that scope, they should get exactly the same deference. But in any event, our position is consistent with, and really is -- our position is the position that's been in the Treasury Department regulations since 19 -- the early 1940's, and if there were any doubt about what these provisions mean, those regulations should be given effect --"

    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to essentially focus on three basic points, what the Court held in Nierotko, the importance of the 1946 amendments to the Social Security Act on both the benefits and the tax side, and then finally try to discuss and balance the relative positions with respect to the administrative convenience or inconvenience of the various positions taken here today. With respect to Nierotko, I think I understand the United States to have finally conceded that the pivotal language in the Nierotko decision is the wages-paid language, and that there is no meaningful distinction between the wages-paid language that was the basis for the interpretation in that case and the wages-paid language that we have inherited now that is the subject of the provisions that are at issue in this particular case. But to the extent that there is any question on that, I would ask the Court to recognize first of all it's clear that the Court was interpreting the 1939 amendments, which contains that language. The first paragraph of the opinion refers to quarters of coverage, which was a concept that did not exist prior to 1939, so it clearly had '39 in mind at that point. And then if you look at the penultimate and the ultimate paragraph of the Supreme Court -- of this Court's opinions, it also discusses quite specifically that -- the provision that's at stake here and it says, you know, the petitioner argues, to put it into context, the amendments of 1939 use quarters as the basis for eligibility as well as the measure of benefits, and require wages to be paid in certain quarters, and this Court then, in rejecting essentially that argument said, we have no doubt that it, referring to back pay, should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual. I think there's no other way to interpret Nierotko except for saying that language of wages paid in the benefits context, certainly, means that you allocate it back to when those wages should have been paid under the -- under that particular scheme. It's a special rule for back pay. Obviously, it doesn't deal with the general accrual problems. It doesn't resurrect any of the accrual problems. It doesn't ask you to try to make those kinds of decisions. It asks you to say, when would they have been paid if the employer --"

Let's be clear about this, there is an entire set of accounting rules for Social Security that exist today, and a complete set of accounting rules that apply under the IRS, and as I understand the Government's position, Social Security is absolutely right in its interpretation of what's required here, so if you're going to have consistency in this approach, the only way you can have consistency is by moving the IRS over to the Social Security side."

Now, once they make that decision, they sweep away the little subsidiary argument which is that it couldn't mean that because otherwise you'd have to allocate, and they say, oh, no, go allocate. All right. So I think of it, where Congress said that wages include back pay, you allocate, and now I think, this isn't that, and Congress didn't even say that. Congress wasn't talking about taxes. The Court never thought Congress was talking about taxes. They weren't talking about some general allocation rule. They were talking about the allocation of the back pay which counts as wages for purposes of the Social Security Act. You see why I kept thinking it was different?"

      "speaker": "FELDMAN",
      "speech": "It is for me now, moderately. I think one of the points actually I wanted to make is that, to look carefully at what happened in 1946. This Court decided Nierotko. There's not a trace of any indication in the legislative history of the 1946 amendments that Congress had any idea that Nierotko had been decided. They certainly did not say, we are trying to conform anything to Nierotko, so that's the first point. The second point is, what they did do there is, they also did not change the specific provision that was at issue in Nierotko, which was a benefits provision. It was a definition of who is a fully qualified individual. They didn't change that at all, and so they didn't discuss it. What they did change was the tax provision for the wage base, and that provision they changed to move it to the wages-paid rule, which they had started to bring in in 1939, and they had said why they did that, to avoid the confusion and difficulties that the other rule had caused. Finally, then, they changed the wage base in the Social Security Act, which was not at issue in Nierotko, because that had nothing to do with wage bases. It had to do with who was a fully qualified -- they changed that, and they said, well, we're doing this just to conform with what we've done with the tax provisions. I think if you put it all together, what the clear intent was, was to keep the taxes easily collectible, and to pursue the ease of administration that they had started in 1939, and then just to bring the Social Security wage base definition in line with that, but I don't think saying that meant in any way, or there's no reason to think that Congress thought that what -- if they were aware at all of Nierotko, that it had anything to do with taxes. As far as the Social Security -- just two other very brief points. One is that the Social Security Publication 957 discusses what they -- their method is, and they do give an option, because they say you can -- you report the back pay on your W-2, and then if you file another filing allocating it back, we'll look at that. If you don't, you can just leave it allocated on the W-2 for the year it was paid. And finally, just one other point that I thought was interesting is that the 19 -- Mr. Phillips referred to the 1943 income tax provision that did allow some attributing back pay to prior years. That was limited to where it was 15 percent or more of your wages, but this was a statute which they enacted, and it's called Section 119, Back Pay Attributable to Prior Years, and it starts off, if the amount of back pay received or accrued by an individual, and so on. So when Congress wanted to address the back pay problem in the income tax context, right around this time, they did it, they did it in express language, they kept that into effect, in effect for a certain number of years, they limited it to where it's more than 15 percent of the income, and then they got rid of it when they found that that was too difficult to work, in, I think, 1961 or so. None of those things happened with respect to, in 1946 with respect to the Nierotko decision, or the FICA and FUTA taxes at issue here. Thank you."
