If an inmate does not have a freestanding right to receive legal assistance, as this Court stated in Lewis v. Casey, then the corollary must be true, an inmate does not have a freestanding right to render legal assistance.

I thought that the position of the United States was that this should be remanded for consideration of those factors of that part of the case in light of Turner v. Safley. Is that wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OHLER",
      "speech": "That is the position of the United States, and that is a position that we disagree with. It's our position that once the cloak of special protection is removed from the legal advice, the legal advice privilege as we termed it in the brief, the question is whether or not legal advice under the Turner analysis, or whether or not the prison's disciplinary policy under the Turner analysis is reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest, and we believe it is. Once that determination has been made, that the policy is valid and, in fact, the respondent has conceded that, he's not contested the facial validity of that policy, but once the validity of that policy under Turner is determined, then the only question, we believe, is whether or not Mr. Murphy in fact violated the policy and, as I mentioned to Justice Scalia's question, he has not raised that question, and that's a due process question that was not raised below. In Turner itself the court did not distinguish between legal communications and other types of communication between inmates, and there is no logical reason why legal communication should be entitled to any different standard of review than other types of speech, including political speech."

Do you think then the so-called inmate law clerk would have a privilege to communicate with the inmate that he's representing? It's maybe a little hard for you to answer, because we have to assume a lot of regulations and stuff that are not in play, but just to flat out say that there's never this right is somewhat -- goes somewhat far, I think."

I mean, really, all you're asserting in this case is that normal prison regulations, including those against displaying insolence towards the prison guards, do not become suspended when there are communications involving legal representation. Isn't that as far as we would have to go in order to give you all that you're interested in here?"

In fact, I think this Court used that language in the Primus case, dealt with access to courts by free citizens, and providing free citizens with the tools to gain a foothold into the court and to advance their civil rights, and there is a large amount of jurisprudence from this Court relative to the right of access as it applies to inmates, and we believe that that jurisprudence controls, relative to the right of access by inmates in a prison setting."

I mean, I can understand how it's not good for prison discipline to allow prisoners to incite one another against the guards. If that's what you're talking about, it makes sense, but how one letter from one prisoner to another prisoner confronts the prison guards, that's beyond me."

In our view prisoners -- and in this Court's view, prisoners have a right of access to the courts to press their own grievances and claims, but this Court has never recognized a freestanding First Amendment right on the part of other inmates to get involved in each others' litigation efforts. That is particularly true when the litigating inmate is already represented by an attorney. In Lewis v. Casey, this Court held that while inmates must be allowed to bring suits challenging their own convictions and conditions of confinement, impairment of any other litigating capacity, and that would include serving as a legal advisor, is simply going to be incidental and perfectly constitutional consequences of conviction and incarceration."

What we're saying should be remanded is whether there's an as-applied constitutional challenge to application of those regulations to this communication."

Safley analysis, but you could still find that a comment to a guard that, you know, that's a bad hair cut, would fall within the meaning of insolence, and so would fall within the regulation, but would not survive a Turner v.

That's a rather strange view. Well, anyway --"

      "speech": "I'm sorry if I misunderstood your question. Our only position is that there certainly may be circumstances, in fact, in which it would be appropriate for a prison to say, there shall be no communications at all between inmates, either curfew times, or lockdown situations, or high security --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I thought this involved such a situation. The person to whom respondent wanted to communicate was in a maximum security section."

      "speech": "He was."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And I had understood the prison did not permit communication from prisoners in other parts of the prison with lesser restrictions to prisoners in the maximum security. Am I wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLETT",
      "speech": "Our understanding is that he was allowed to write a letter to this inmate, so there was not a complete ban on communication between people, inmates in respondent's category and this high risk, or this maximum security unit. There was not a complete ban on communications. It was just the content of this letter. Clearly, any communication that is written between prisoners must be consistent with valid penalogical limitations on those, and those would include that communications not be insolent or incite one inmate against another, inmate against another or against guards or prison staff. The important thing, we think, to keep in mind with respect to the Ninth Circuit's rule is that the Turner v. Safley test is sufficient for purposes of analyzing any First Amendment claims to speech or other rights invoked by prisoners and that beyond that, prison correspondence involving legal advice does not have any special exemption from those rules, should not be analyzed under any separate standard and, in fact, can present the exact same dangers that routine correspondence does. They can -- according special status, as the Ninth Circuit has done, to inmate correspondence could allow that type of correspondence to become a ready vehicle for secretly coded communications and other illicit communications. Jailhouse lawyers are frequently a menace to prison discipline, and they could be allowed through special treatment to set up an order or a hierarchy that would compete with the prison order system. In addition, the circulation among inmates of potentially volatile allegations and accusations can, in the judgment of prison officials, exacerbate the already extremely tense relations between prison officials and inmates and that, much like in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners Labor Union, where this Court held that prisoner communications, prisoner assertions of First Amendment speech and association rights that are focused on encouraging an increase in adversarial relations between prison and staff can be regulated and restricted consistent with legitimate penalogical objectives. And finally, it's important to keep in mind that there are ample alternative channels for inmates to communicate information bearing on a case. They can communicate with attorneys, Government officials, courts and other members of the public. They may bring their own grievances or lawsuits. The appropriate analysis, we think, is Turner v. Safley and, beyond that, the -- to the extent someone is concerned about information getting into courts. Thank you."

As I understand the State's position, so long as their rules are neutrally drawn, and so long as the rules on their face satisfy Turner, then they are free to apply them in any manner in which they deem fit. I don't think that Turner says that. I don't think that Turner nor Abbott contemplate that. This is an as-applied case, it was an as- applied case, and it always has been an as-applied case, with the single exception that Mr. Murphy challenged the rules on their face as vague, and the vagueness issue, the facial vagueness issue is not before this Court. This case is strictly about punishment of content of speech. I think there are several issues here that are not in dispute. First, this is speech that, if uttered outside the prison, is without question protected by the First Amendment. Second, this communication was permitted within the prison. That is, Mr. Murphy was permitted under the prison's regulations to write to Mr. Tracy. And third, if these two things are true, as they are, then Turner and Abbott provide the analytical framework for this case."

It's a declaration that an as-applied challenge, this challenge, this communication, this instance only, is valid because there's a First Amendment violation, and yet with respect to this specific instance you're not asking for any relief. It doesn't seem to fit into any of our recognized categories of litigable issues."

I was going to say, as a general proposition, you've already got that in Turner and Safley, and you either want something specific to this case, though without any relief in this particular case, or you want something broader, and when you state what the broader relief is that you might want, it seems to be about the same level of generality as Turner and Safley itself, so we're stuck as to what we can do for you --"

What you asked for in your complaint was a declaration that Rule 009 and 022 are too vague, and that this violated -- and that you can't have a policy in a prison which says content of a letter is relevant to discipline."

      "speech": "I think so. I mean, we're sort of jumping down the road here when we talk about the form of relief. I mean, the form of relief hasn't been crafted yet, and I think that we can do that."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Renz, I don't want to invade your attorney-client privilege or anything like that, so don't answer the question if you think it's improper, but I'm just very puzzled, how is it that you're not challenging the discipline to your client, when you're challenging the basis for the discipline?"

      "speaker": "RENZ",
      "speech": "Well, as we read Edwards -- well, Edwards hadn't been decided yet. As we read Heck and played Heck out it was argued that we were not in a position to purge the sanction against him. To the extent that --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    {
      "speaker": "RENZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You could get it expunged later. I mean, this is a strange manner of litigating, that you bring a declaratory judgment that something that's been done to you was unlawful, and then bring a second suit to undo what was done to you because it has been declared to be unlawful. I don't understand it. I'm not sure that the conditions for a declaratory judgment exist when it is -- I mean, it is equitable relief, and I'm not sure a court should provide it --"
