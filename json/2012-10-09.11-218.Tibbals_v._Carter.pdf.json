      "speaker": "SCHIMMER",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here from the Sixth Circuit, which held that habeas claims can be stayed indefinitely because prisoners have a statutory right to competence to assist in their case, but even Mr. Carter now disowns the circuit's rationale, and the court's indefinite stay order was wrong for two other reasons. First, habeas claims cannot be stayed indefinitely. Doing so is fundamentally incompatible with the timeliness concerns underlying AEDPA. Second, while we readily acknowledge that limited stays will be appropriate in some situations, this is not one of them. All of Mr. Carter's claims are record based and, therefore, resolvable without his assistance."

      "speech": "Limited stays, we think, Your Honor, would be stay -- appropriate in situations where the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary to his claim. And we think that would be true in a case, potentially, where AEDPA does not restrict Federal review to the state court record. So here, for instance, we think that the prisoner's assistance would not be necessary, and therefore, even a limited stay would not be appropriate because all of Mr. Carter's claims were vetted before the state courts and decided on the merits. And therefore, under 2254(d), in this Court's decision in Pinholster, the Federal court is limited to reviewing the state court record. We don't think that the prisoner's assistance in that case is necessary. We don't think Mr. Carter has made a case for why his assistance would be necessary in this specific case."

And to the extent that all of the parties in this case agree now that, to the extent district courts have some power to issue stays -- we say only limited stays -- in these cases, that power is grounded in equitable discretion. And we do not think that it comports with equitable discretion to allow a prisoner essentially to win his case, to obtain a suspension of his capital sentence, the ultimate end relief that he seeks - -"

So we do think that -- moving forward, that no indefinite stay should be permitted. And when the courts move forward, yes, if someone's competency is later restored, there are backstops. The person, certainly in Ohio, can always go back to state court and - -"

That, of course, was a case where a prisoner was seeking to abandon his further appeals. There are multiple reasons why we -- why we think that Rees does not endorse the power of Federal courts to indefinitely stay habeas proceedings. One is the fact that the Court's stay order was completely unexplained and very terse. It didn't announce any rule of law. Second, the historical record shows that the Court's stay in Rees was, at most, a judicially negotiated settlement, meaning far from a demonstration of the Court's inherent power. It seemed to be a very carefully orchestrated exercise of consented-to power. The third point is that - -"

Are you opposing those kinds of stays?"

About 90 percent of them are restored within 6 to 9 months. So we think, presumptively, a year would be an appropriate period of time for - -"

It's a case where the client might be expected to provide information that's -- let's -- let's assume it's necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas claim. Why would you cut it off at a year? Why wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and fair adjudication couldn't take place in those circumstances."

And the bottom line is that we think that - -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",

We're just going to come back to it periodically. But if the answer is the same, which is that the client's participation is necessary for a full and fair adjudication, then the court's answer should be the same, too. Why isn't that right?"

      "speaker": "SCHIMMER",
      "speech": "Because we do think that there comes a point, given the finality concerns underlying AEDPA, that a limited stay, when that window expires -- the person has a reasonable period of time to be restored to competency; that when that window expires, at some point, the proceedings do have to continue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, it's really -- it's really not the same question when it comes back, is it? Because there are two questions: Is -- is reasonable competence useful for his defense? But, also, the second question, is there a reasonable probability that he can be restored to competence? The first time, there obviously is that, and you give him a year. When you come back a second time, you say, well, it's been a year, they usually come back within 6 to 9 months, there is no longer a reasonable probability."

      "speaker": "SCHIMMER",
      "speech": "That's exactly right, Justice Scalia. And to the extent that we are balancing different parties' interests in these cases, after the preliminary limited stay expires, we believe at that point the prisoner's interest in a continued stay has diminished, and the state's interest in the proceedings continuing and moving forward has then increased, and that the court should then move on."

      "speaker": "SCHIMMER",
      "speech": "That would be the threshold question, and there seems to be a good amount of consensus on that point. It's the test articulated by the Sixth and Ninth Circuits and by my colleague here today. And we're -- we're willing to accept that as the test for when limited stays can be imposed.

They can't come back if they are later competent, if they first lose their claims, because they didn't have the evidence they needed and then try again later. They are subject to the bar on second or successive petitions, which requires, not only that they have new facts, but also that they have new law.

This doesn't happen very often.

Let's say you have a case where there is a small amount of mitigating evidence about the petitioner's childhood, but not enough to -- to sway the -- the sentencing authority. It's alleged that if the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more information about what went on during his childhood years; and, therefore, the -- the proceeding has to be stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to confidence or he dies, as happened in Rees.

We're not talking -- it's not a matter of simply examining Mr. Carter today and saying, How do you feel? What do you experience? Are you hearing the voice of the devil? But it's a question of was he doing that during his trial 14 years ago? And that's why it's important that he be able to participate now. What the Sixth Circuit ordered in this case was a remand for a narrow stay with appropriate monitoring by the district court, to make sure that this didn't become -- just sit around on the docket for years with nobody looking at it."

Now, I admit that's not a fact in -- in the record, but that's something that, if we're dispositive, could be established on remand in this case. So it's because of the -- the rarity of these claims, because they are not going to come up every day, and because district courts exist as strong checkpoints to prevent non-genuine claims of competence or not potentially meritorious claims for which the petitioner's assistance is necessary, a narrow stay authority should be preserved and should be applied to Mr. Carter's case."

He had claims about prosecutorial misconduct. He has a claim about the method of execution that the State of Ohio uses. These claims may go forward because they don't require his assistance.

So that, we think, resolves that. And in terms of how do you deal with limited stays and then going on, we would say simply that the State of Ohio's experience in this case has been that the State of Ohio has been standing ready for 10 years to defend the judgment of its state courts in this case, even though all of Mr. Carter's claims are record based. There is no right to competence. Everybody seems to now agree on that. Indefinite stays contravene AEDPA, and we don't think that any stay is justified here because of the record-based claims.
