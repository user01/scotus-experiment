      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In February of 2001, an international arbitration panel, convened under the North American Free Trade Agreement, concluded that the United States' continuation of a blanket ban or a moratorium on the operation of Mexican domiciled commercial carriers beyond the border zone in the United States violated NAFTA. excuse me -- his intention to comply with the arbitration decision by invoking power specifically vested in him by Congress to lift the moratorium in order to comply with an international trade agreement. And the President in fact did lift the moratorium in November of 2002. In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency in the Department of Transportation that is limited to a -- a safety mandate, was required to conduct an elaborate and complex environmental analysis of the President's foreign trade and foreign policy decision before it could enter or issue procedural safety regulations that were necessary to implement the President's decision. The Ninth Circuit set aside the procedural regulations on that ground and thereby prevented the agency from granting certification to carriers that under the President's decision were eligible to receive it. The Ninth Circuit's decision is incorrect and it has frustrated the President's ability to comply with Congress and the President, the two entities whose joint action brought about the lifting of the moratorium, are not subject to either NEPA or the provisions of the Clean Air Act that respondents rely on to require an environmental analysis. Accordingly, the agency acted entirely reasonably in choosing to take the President's action as a given, including any increased traffic or trade that might occur as a result of the President's decision and to, instead, focus its own environmental analysis on the effects of its own procedural regulations. FMCA's government -- governing statute requires it to grant registration to any carrier that is willing and able to comply with applicable safety, safety fitness, and financial responsibility requirements. The agency has no authority to deny operating permission to a carrier, foreign or domestic, based on environmental concerns or foreign trade concerns. It has no authority to countermand the President's decision or to refuse to issue the regulations that were necessary to implement the President's decision."

      "speech": "There was. And -- and soon thereafter, the -- the moratorium was imposed in 1982 originally, but it conferred on the President the power to lift the moratorium, and an agreement was arrived at soon thereafter with Canada. So since the early '80's, enter. retained in effect by the President through subsequent actions into the '90's. In the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States included a reservation to a complete opening of the border for transporter operations by carriers subject to a phase-out, initially a phase-out that would allow carriers from Mexico to operate in any of the border States -- that was 3 years after the agreement was signed -- and then by the year 2000, to allow the carriers to operate anywhere in the United States. The President decided not to go forward with that because of concerns about whether the safety regulatory regime in Mexico was sufficient to prepare the Mexican carriers to come into the United States. So that is the reason why it was held up. And -- and the basis of the NAFTA arbitration panel's decision was that a blanket prohibition on that ground was not -- was -- was not permissible under NAFTA and that the United States had to consider applications from Mexican carriers on a case-by-case basis. It could adopt special procedures to ensure that the carriers who would be permitted to come in under the President's lifting of the moratorium would satisfy the substantive safety standards. And that is the set of regulations that are at issue here. But it's important to recognize that these are not substantive safety standards. The substance -- the standards that -- that Mexican carriers, like -- like other foreign and domestic carriers in the United States have to comply with, are -- have already been in place. All that we are talking about here are essentially procedural or administrative regulations."

DOT's assessment that its regulations will cause emissions below the amounts specified in 40 C.F.R. 93, thus excusing it from making a conformitory determination is based on the predicted emissions in its EA. As we have already determined, however, DOT failed to conduct a reliable environmental analysis because of its illusory distinction between the effects of the regulations themselves, which is what we've been talking about, and the effects of the presidential rescission of the moratorium. It seems to me it was essential to the Ninth Circuit's decision that you have to take into account, President's decision. The Ninth Circuit did not base it just on the effects of the regulations themselves."

Now, it's very important to understand that the way Congress set this up was it's not that the agency is somehow overriding a presidential decision. There are two separate and independent decisions here. The President has authority over trade issues the way Congress gave him that authority. But the Congress at the same time said that the agency has authority over safety issues. These are two separate things."

My question is, does the agency have to prepare an impact statement saying we're letting in the old as well as the new, but in letting in the old, we're letting in more highly polluting trucks?

Now, if you have two a year, in fact, there will be fewer trucks. If you go to one a year, there might be more trucks coming in and then you will have more pollution. Now, if that's a significant difference, then I guess the agency does have to go into it. But if they have an EA that tells them, you know, it's not that big a deal because they're going to be about the same number of trucks regardless, then I would think the burden would be on the environmentalists to show that that's really wrong. And I think that's the kind of argument you're making. And you're telling me that it's so obviously wrong that even though you didn't raise it in the agency, they should have figured it out. Is -- is that where we are? accurate about where we are. And -- and the fact is that there were numerous comments to the agency about the safety things that it should have done and didn't, and there are numerous -- there's numerous -- there's a lot of room between the standards that are being imposed on trucks coming over the border from Mexico and the standards that are in -- on U.S. trucks. The agency could have made choices that would affect this, that would affect the safety, and that would also affect the environment. And the agency concedes that. The agency concedes it had the discretion, and it concedes that this could affect the environment. What the agency does is say that that's all about the President because the President lifted the moratorium. But where that is a mistake is because Congress was the -- was the body that said when trucks can come over, and it gave both the President and the agency separate authority over that. So it all goes back to Congress in making this -- this foreign commerce decision. Now, before I finish my argument, I did want to talk about the Clean Air Act because this is very important.

But the second sentence is the critical sentence, which is when an agency, quote, takes actions itself or imposes conditions that result in air pollutant emissions. Well, in this case, the agency is -- is taking action and imposing conditions that are going to result in emissions because under 350, no trucks come in at all until the agency makes these choices and because in making the choices, it's imposing conditions that are going to be absolutely determinative as to what the -- the pollutants -- how much pollution there's going to be.
