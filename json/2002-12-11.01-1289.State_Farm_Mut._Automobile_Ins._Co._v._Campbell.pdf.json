There was evidence in the record, uncontroverted evidence, that this was the only case in the State of Utah where a policyholder of State Farm had been subject to potentially a threat of execution on a judgment.

It is a personnel evaluation guide on how to evaluate personnel, and it applies to all, all the personnel of State Farm, all thousands of personnel, and what the plaintiff did was to cherry-pick from this long manual which is in the lodging, as I said, one or two points that didn't even apply to claims adjustors or claims representatives, but to supervisors, to try to create this pervasive nationwide scheme that there was an attempt by State Farm over 20 years to lessen the claims that they were paying and not pay the fair value of claims."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the answer is that all that does go to reprehensibility. It does. A person who commits this conduct and is part of a company that engages in all kinds of bad action is a person who is somewhat more reprehensible than if you worked for a company that doesn't engage in all this bad action, but I thought your point was that that's true, but unless you draw a line like the line that was drawn in Gore, you are inviting a jury to punish the company for all kinds of things that truly do make them more reprehensible, but without standards, without a legislature telling them how reprehensible, et cetera."

      "speech": "Because it had nothing to do with what happened here, and I'd like to explain to you. Maybe it's a little -- but what happens in third party and first party cases, in this particular case there was a decision to go to trial. Why was that decision made to go to trial? Because at least the lawyers for State Farm in some of the claims represented felt this was a no liability case. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell said that they were not liable, that they didn't cause this accident. This wasn't a no-brainer. There was evidence. The jury decided on other evidence. But when you bring into this equation 20 years of conduct that, some of it that is lawful, this wasn't only fraudulent conduct. This jury heard and was instructed -- not instructed, but in the summation there was references to the payment of non-OEM, the specification of non-OEM parts, was perfectly legal in almost every jurisdiction."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

Of course, when it came to the ratio guidepost, this Court has repeatedly said there has to be a reasonable relationship, reasonable ratio between the penalty, the punishment, and the harm to the plaintiff: not the harm to others, not the harm to the community at large, not the harm to all of the consumers that dealt with State Farm, as the Utah Supreme Court held and found, and --"

In TXO it permitted 10 to 1 because economic damages was small, and you looked at potential harm as well as the realized harm to the litigant there. Here, he had substantial compensatory damages. In addition, if you look at the third guidepost in Gore, you have comparable penalties and sanctions for comparable conduct. That's how that is defined. What was the conduct here?

This, in a way this reminds me of the argument we heard last week -- maybe it was last session -- about the three strikes law in California; that you're not necessarily punished for the other things you did, but you can take into account your prior crimes even in other States in order to justify a more severe penalty for what you've done here. And isn't it -- part of the argument the other side makes is that this is a very large company, and the board of directors doesn't hear about a $100-million punitive damage award down in Texas, and therefore you've got to at least give them enough money so the board of directors will know they ought to take corrective steps."

Let me just mention one other part of the guideposts which I think are very relevant here, and that is comparable penalties for comparable misconduct, and here it is uncontroverted that the penalty that the Utah courts or the Utah system could have placed on State Farm for an act, for a single act of bad faith failure to settle, which was at stake here, was $10,000. Yet when the Utah Supreme Court examined that guidepost from the Court, it looked at the scheme. It looked at all of the nationwide conduct to determine that 1) you could be -- you would have to disgorge all your profits or you could be imprisoned, which was not correct anyhow under the Utah statute. But if you restate the guideposts that you have already come down with, and you make it clear that we're talking about conduct that was permitted to the plaintiffs, that we're talking about reasonable ratios that had to do with the plaintiff's wrong, not harm to others, not harm to all of those in Utah -- in fact, if you look at the bad faith failure to settle issue, there was no one in the State of Utah that was harmed by that kind of conduct. There was nobody that was even subject, Justice Breyer, for a short time with execution, and that -- and there was no reason, there was no reason to deter that kind of conduct because there was no conduct in the future, after the Campbell case, that that even came close to. So I think that if you focus on those factors, those guideposts that you elucidated to in Gore, and make them stronger, that would be sufficient for the lower courts to do their job in doing a meaningful -- meaningful appellate review, not the kind of review here that was based on questionable conclusions and improper predicates.

Much of the evidence certainly wasn't produced through discovery. The key evidence, including the May 1979 PP&R report, was obtained indirectly through other cases, not with any cooperation on the part of State Farm. State Farm kept saying, we don't have a PP&R policy. Oh, and then we got rid of it in 1992; and we got rid of it again in 1994; and yes, there's a PP&R policy, but it doesn't actually set the cap on any particular claim. Well, that's a nicely and artfully put point. It doesn't. What it does is, it imposes a ceiling which averages things out and forces whoever is unlucky enough to come in when somebody is about to hit his ceiling to get cheated. It seems to me that we -- it's true that it all began by looking at this, as it happened, failure to settle. That's a happenstance. It could have begun in some other way. Because it happened to a couple that was rather vulnerable, and yet tenacious: this fellow had had one wife who had been murdered in his home, another wife who had died of cancer. He himself had Parkinson's disease. They were part of the weakest of the herd, as State Farm's policies put it, that they're picked on, because they're less likely to fight back. But it happened that these people did fight back, and it seems to me it's not a matter of rewarding them. They get a relatively small piece of this. The family of the dead young man gets part of it. The State may get part of it. The key point is that it is a critical disincentive, and Justice Kennedy, any notion --"

What was critical is that they had built a wall of deniability so that no one in a decisionmaking capacity is informed of punitive judgments. Mr. Muskowski testified in this case that he would not let anyone know, in a position of authority, even of the punitive judgment in this case; and in their reply brief they say, well, Mr. Mendoza had decisionmaking authority, but if you look at the relevant pages in the joint appendix, you'll see that that's not true. In the colloquy it's clear that he did not. What that means is that a company can surround itself with an impregnable wall and in effect spit at the legal system. How good is that for its image? Now, it may be that an ideal legal system might not use juries for this purpose, but is it the mission of this Court to redesign the legal systems of the 50 States? 15 States have signed an amicus brief here saying it's important to them to be able to use punitive damages when the regulatory and criminal justice systems haven't quite caught up with whatever latest axis of evil is afoot in the corporate world. Is it really helpful to any of us to have a corporation be able to defraud all of the people who rely on it, who depend on it, and get away with paying simply what harm they happened to cause in the one case when they get caught? It seems to me especially bizarre, especially bizarre for State Farm to speak here proudly of the fact that this is the worst case in history."

That is, they didn't just engage in de novo review of the question of excessiveness. They engaged in de novo review of all the facts, so you have not just a jury, but a jury and a trial court and a full appellate court. The only fact on which they said they weren't going to defer was a technical issue about the wealth of State Farm, and the real reason they actually gave for increasing the 25 to 145 was their conviction that the trial court believed that 25 would not stop State Farm from persisting in its practices, and that it was only their own earlier suggestion that the ratio should matter a great deal that had misled the trial court."

But to your question, Justice Scalia, on ratio, I think that instead of trying to come up with a number -- because I think suggesting any number would be so arbitrary that it would do more damage to this Court than good to the legal system. It's not like 6 months for the idea of a serious crime. I mean, it would just be a number plucked from the air, and it would backfire, because as the law and economics people are fond of pointing out, any number you pick will then lead people to sort of modify their behavior accordingly, and just internalize the costs on a kind of bad man theory, and what you really are trying to do is stop the behavior. We're not talking about negligence here. We're talking about something of which the optimal level is zero. The optimal level of deliberate fraud and deception covered up in this way is zero. The relevance of the ratio, I think, is simply as one thing to look at. If the ratio looks very high, you ask why is it so high? In this case, the answer comes back, it's so high because the ratio of the number of people they hurt to the number who are going to be motivated to sue and able to sue is very low. I mean, is very -- you know, a number -- a huge number will be hurt. A very small number are going to be able to make it through that filter."
