      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At issue in the case is the meaning and scope of the tolling provision applicable to the one-year statute of limitations for Federal habeas cases enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA. The tolling provision states that in calculating the one-year statute of limitations, the period during which a properly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review shall not be counted. The court below held that a prior filed Federal habeas petition dismissed without prejudice and without adjudication on the merits constituted an application for state post-conviction or other collateral review. We contend that the language of the statute, the provision in particular, the statute as a whole, and the policies underlying AEDPA make the Second Circuit's ruling erroneous. First, with respect to the statute, the particular provision at issue, it is notable that the only sovereign entity mentioned in the phrase state post- conviction or other collateral review is state. In a universe in which the only -- the relevant universe being state or Federal, it is absolutely bizarre for Congress to have suggested that Federal should be incorporated by the word other. To hold that would be equivalent to saying that Congress could enact a statute saying red, white, and other colors of the flag. When universe is state and Federal, it's simply illogical to assume that state or other could stand for state or Federal. In fact, in other parts of --"

Lundy the exhaustion requirement is specified as not setting of any kind of a trap for the prisoner. That is, he has to go exhaust, but it's not supposed to muck around with the statute of limitations. So if you win this case, there will be a certain number of cases in which a person thinking -- you know, these people don't know the law that well -- they file a petition in the Federal court, it sits around there for several months, then they discover an unexhausted claim. Then he has to go file it in the state court, and by the time they dispose of that saying you're too late, he's now out of time, so he's never gotten his habeas petition heard. So it seems to me that that policy cuts against you quite -- to me fairly strongly -- and I want to hear what you have to say about it."

Zant where the Court laid down certain rules in respect -- or certain standards with respect to successive petitions. There is no doubt that certain pro se habeas petitioners might, after McClesky, have been denied a bite of the apple of meritorious claims because they weren't included in their first habeas petition. There is no reason to assume that habeas petitioners, after the Court announces a rule here, will not be able to err on the side of exhaustion, which is especially what Congress intended when it enacted In addition to enacting a statute of limitations, Congress enacted a number of provisions designed to enhance and strengthen the exhaustion requirement."

Finality, as this Court has recognized, is especially an important policy when you're talking about state court convictions. On the other hand, Congress was also concerned about comity and ensuring proper respect for state court proceedings and allowing state courts the first bite of the apple of correcting constitutional errors. To toll for the pendency of a state post-conviction or collateral proceeding makes eminent sense in context of the scheme, because it furthers the purpose of finality by limiting the period during which they can file a Federal habeas petition, but it also furthers the concern for comity by encouraging litigants to go to the state court in the first instance. To toll for Federal petitions would undercut the finality goal without concomitantly furthering the comity goal, which was a --"

There used to be Federal courts who have got to hear this kind of case first, and put it at the top of the list. If we were to adopt a position that you are taking, we would be creating a priority because the Federal court would say, oh, my goodness, we better take care of this because if there's an unexhausted claim in it, we've got to make sure that this pro se petitioner gets back to the state court before the clock runs out.

In fact, it's consistent because part of what Congress was -- part of what -- habeas jurisprudence in general has been the interaction and the intersection between Congressional enactment and judicially crafted rule.

If I remember the situation correctly, there was sort of a nonstatutory one-year period of limitations that courts of appeals crafted for the one year after the enactment of the statute that wasn't actually provided for by the statute. I'm just wondering if you'd comment on the suggestion that even if your reading of this particular provision is correct, would it be conceivable that the Federal court, not relying on the statute but just general equitable principles of tolling, might be able to address the hypothetical that Justice Breyer is concerned about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BANSAL",
      "speech": "I think that is correct -- that there are general equitable principles that a lower Federal court could adopt, but I would add that the circumstances under which that power might be exercised are extremely circumscribed. At least eight courts of appeals so far have found an equitable tolling basis with respect to the habeas statute of limitations -- the one-year statute of limitations. And the types of conditions that they've looked to is first the delay during which the habeas petition was brought had to have been for circumstances entirely outside of the petitioner's control. And secondly, the petitioner had to have acted diligently without that period of delay. And some courts -- one court, at least -- in addition has added a potentially meritorious requirement to actually reaching out and addressing that. I think that it's not enough -- or we would contend that it would not simply be enough that a habeas petition would have brought mixed petition in which there were clearly unexhausted claims and had that sit on the district court's docket for about thirteen months before being dismissed. That, in our view, would not be enough to make it clearly outside of the petitioner's control, that that delay occurred because if there was no serious question as to the exhaustion status of the claims, then that's something that the petitioner could have filed properly after exhaustion."

      "speech": "Oh, no, no. They'll go to the state court first. They'll all go. See, and what'll happen is they'll end up finished. Then they'll go into Federal court. Then lo and behold, an idea will strike one of them that he hadn't had before and he'll stick it in his petition and, lo and behold, it will be held by a Federal judge after several months of looking at it, that it has an unexhausted claim in it. I mean, these people are not all represented all the time, and that could happen, couldn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BANSAL",

Lundy, what could happen at that point is that after the district court determines that it's a mixed petition, the habeas petitioner would have the option of deleting the unexhausted claim for purposes of getting the petition heard.

      "speech": "That's correct. I would just like to add that in -- it's often common for this Court, both in the statute of limitations context and the habeas context, to read the plain words that Congress intended, or to fashion a rule that's clean. The subsequent applications of that can be worked out as time goes on, and as experience with the effects of the rule become known. In a statute of limitations context, just last year in the context of the Clayton Act, the Rotella case. And also three years ago in the RICO statute, the Claire case, this Court held strictly what the statute of limitations required, and it subsequently said that we will work out the equitable -- you know, let the issues percolate through the Federal courts and we will determine what, if any, equitable discretion is retained by the courts. In the habeas context as well. In Wainwright v. Sykes, for example, when the Court announced the cause and prejudice rule, the Court specifically said that we will give content to those terms and as time evolves -- certainly with respect to habeas jurisprudence, we believe that it's appropriate that this Court read the language of the statute, as we believe the provision itself states that it's consistent with a statute as a whole and subsequently let the equitable applications of it, and if there are concerns about the difficult hypothetical, to work themselves out."

He filed -- first of all, the district court held onto his petition for a mere three months before dismissing it -- his first Federal habeas petition. He still would have had nearly ten months after that to file a timely petition, to amend his petition, to delete the unexhausted claims, or whatever. He didn't do any of that. He didn't go back to state court during that time. He had an entire ten months in which to act, and instead he waited nearly eleven months and then filed the second Federal habeas petition.

And if you don't find -- and I'm not saying that you shouldn't find, because I do believe it's in the language -- but if you don't find, Justice Kennedy, that Federal habeas petitions are subsumed in the other collateral review piece of (d)(2), you will find the ability to toll the statute under your own powers when you look at habeas jurisprudence the way it has functioned for over --"

And I think the argument on the other side is, you better think carefully before you go into Federal court because the obvious objective here is to get the state litigation over with so we can get the Federal litigation over with, and that object is not going to be served if every time somebody has a delayed good idea, in effect the clock stops. Now, is that a fair reading of the congressional objective? And if it is a fair reading of the congressional objective, then isn't the answer to the late good idea, in effect, too bad, you really should have thought of it before, and if you didn't, you're out."

Lundy and with all the habeas jurisprudence that has evolved over the last century -- that you're supposed to bring your claims in state court. All your claims of unconstitutional confinement must be first brought there. And to the extent that we assign that obligation to the state prisoner, that's a fair obligation. However, it is unfair to assign to the state prisoner the obligation of understanding a very, very complex area of law when he just might have guessed incorrectly. He might have believed he did bring this claim properly before the state court, and that's why --"

Now, Congress has not eliminated Federal habeas, but it certainly cut back on it."

It has established the one-year statute of limitation where none ever existed before, and you were having cases coming into the Federal district courts that could be five years old or ten years old. That has been addressed, and that statute of limitations is not at all affected by the Second Circuit or the Tenth Circuit's ruling, it's intact. What that statute of limitations does -- it does a lot of things, but what it does primarily -- it really defines what we mean by diligence. If you're within that one year, you're diligent. If you're outside that one year, you're not diligent and you're out of luck. You've got no Federal review, no merits review whatsoever, Your Honor."

It's very hard to decipher what it is he's trying to make out, and you're ascribing to him -- the state would ascribe to him -- this ability to understand if he's exhausted or not. That's an absurd position to put the petitioner in, and what makes it absurd and unfair is to state that the time that this petition with this unexhausted or maybe unexhausted claim that's in front of the Federal district court counts against him when he can't control that length of time. He can't control how long it's in the clerk's office, he can't control how long the prosecutor is going to ask for an adjournment to respond to it."

In your view, would the Federal judge in that situation have the authority to keep the case on the docket while the case is -- as an abstention case while the claim is exhausted, or do you agree with your opponent that it would have to be dismissed at that point?"

    {
      "speaker": "LOEWENBERG",

      "speaker": "LOEWENBERG",

      "speaker": "LOEWENBERG",
      "speech": "Absolutely. And then we're totally out of time. It's very, very difficult. The position that the state takes also works against the theory behind exhaustion. The theory of comity and federalism is not advanced by the state's position at all, and that's because the Federal district court, when it's reviewing the petition to see whether or not claims are exhausted, the Federal district court has always felt comfortable dismissing without prejudice in order to enable the state court to really, really look at the claims that are made. But the state's position will, for fair-minded district court judges, it will have those judges make determinations on exhaustion, on close questions, and find that there has been exhaustion.

And if it was, maybe my position would be a little bit different, but I still need to take this Court back to the original language.

They would basically, as this Court has suggested, eliminate the word state which is a very big word to eliminate from a statute. But furthermore, we believe the policy concerns that they raised are entirely unfounded at this point -- speculative and premature. First of all, in terms of the options the district courts already have, the reasons this won't lead to a harsh result in the vast majority of cases are as follows. Prisoners will be required to err first on the side of exhaustion. There is no reason to believe that they can't do that in the vast majority of cases. If there are mixed petitions that ultimately go before the district court, the prisoner at that point would have the opportunity to delete the unexhausted claims in order to have the exhausted claims continue to be heard. Third, the district courts can reach out and decide the merits of unexhausted claims if it's for purposes of denying the petition. And since the vast majority of claims actually end up being unmeritorious, this actually provides the mechanism for the prisoner to achieve substantive Federal habeas review."

The only other possible purpose that it could serve would be respect for state court processes, which isn't implicated when you're talking about tolling for Federal petitions.

I mean, the concern that respondent raises -- I mean, this is just Congress clearly intended -- or they contemplated that there might be some harsh results, regardless of the Rose v. Lundy situation. Forget about the mixed petition situation. It could be that a petitioner decides thirteen months after his judgment becomes final that he may have a meritorious Federal habeas claim. Well, it doesn't matter. Under the statute of limitations, he's out of time. The fact that he first filed one month into the statute of limitations -- the fact that he might have filed a petition that is unexhausted and that doesn't meet the procedural requirements and therefore requires dismissal without prejudice -- that can't change the results. I mean, petitioners are supposed to act in mind with the procedural rules. This Court has recognized that in repeated contexts, even when we're talking about pro se litigants, and I believe Justice Stevens said that in the McNeil case when we're talking about the Federal Tort Claims Act. Procedural rules are designed to have regularity. Congress enacted a harsh -- arguably harsh statute. Thirteen month meritorious claim? It doesn't matter. The person is out of time."
