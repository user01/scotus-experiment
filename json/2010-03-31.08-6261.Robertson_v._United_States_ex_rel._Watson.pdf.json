The United States now agrees that the fact that a criminal offense may only be prosecuted by the sovereign is a foundational premise of our Constitution.

We have never argued, if it was actually her prosecuting, that -- that she was bound by the plea agreement. We argued it can't be her prosecuting, it can't be under the Constitution, it can't be under the local statute.

We don't read it that no other government agency is bound, who has jurisdiction over that criminal activity, that they are equally bound. So why isn't this case the same? Assuming -- that you're making a broad statement, that this has to be brought in the name of the government.

But all the offenses we're talking about here are United States offenses. It was the United States's position below that only the United States prosecutes contempt. It was actually the Attorney General's conviction in the lower court that it could not, representing the District of Columbia, prosecute contempt. So that if we are construing the party to be the United States as the Solicitor General now asks -­ you know, Young and Providence Journal really apply, which is then the prosecuting entity is the United States, whether represented by a private prosecutor or by a United States attorney. That's a very different situation than different offices or -- because the District of Columbia could not be prosecuting this case representing the -- the Attorney General couldn't be prosecuting this case representing the District of Columbia government. That's not in the picture as an option. The -- the case -- if it's prosecuted by a sovereign, it's prosecuted by the United States, and the only argument that the Solicitor General is now making is that that wouldn't bind if private prosecutor representing the United States, as happened in Young. We have a local case that says when a private prosecutor in a criminal contempt case signs the plea agreement on behalf of the United States, it's a binding plea agreement and binds the -- the United States. So the cross-out on the plea form, I believe, are a bit of a red herring. The cross-out on the caption just makes it read United States v. John Robertson in a felony, which is the only way felonies can be prosecuted. The cross-out on the signature line just makes it read the United States Attorney, who is the only one who can sign such a form in a felony case. And it doesn't define a particular prosecuting entity between Federal and State, or between two different Federal jurisdictions that have concurrent jurisdiction over, let's say, mail fraud or something like that."

That's what the lower court said. If that's what occurred, then we believe this Court could well say that is unconstitutional. We -- we defer to the lower court's view of what occurred pursuant to the local statute. This was a private right of action, the lower court told us so, and we don't think that the Constitution can tolerate such a thing. And, therefore, like in Gompers where criminal penalty was imposed, Gompers v. Buck's Stove, a criminal penalty was imposed in an action between private parties, that judgment must be set aside.

And so the District of Columbia's role, oddly enough, all the way through this proceeding and then they withdrew at the merits stage in this Court, was they believed themselves representing the Petitioner. They had never perceived themselves to be a public prosecutor. And they in fact said in the lower court that they had no authority to prosecute contempt in the District of Columbia.

But we see a long, long history in the common law, in the English common law, in our common law, and in our constitutional jurisprudence of criminal actions being public wrongs prosecuted acting on behalf of the sovereign and criminal contempt falling right within that even more so, because this is indication of public authority, and to the extent there are any deviations from due process or separation of powers principles, they are justified only by the doctrine of necessity.

We are drawing a fairly rigid distinction between who the lawyer is and who the lawyer represents. In our view, the party in a criminal action has to be the sovereign, the United States. Now in the contempt context there is a limited exception for appointment of private prosecutors when the executive is declining to prosecute and the judiciary needs to vindicate its authority, and if it's referred to the public prosecutor in the Young situation and the public prosecutor has declined but the judiciary still needs to vindicate its authority, it can appoint a private attorney to represent the sovereign. But at root it's the sovereign that is prosecuting, no matter who the lawyer is who is standing in the courtroom. And the problem in this case was the holding of the lower court that said -- that Ms. Watson -- it was her case.

My view is this Court should go with the Third and Fourth Circuits who have -- expressed -- quite eloquently about the United States not being a bunch of separate fiefdoms, but that when the United States speaks, they speak for the government at large. That is different than a case -­ of some of the cases that were cited, where it says the United States will make a recommendation to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and then the criminal defendant comes back and says well, the INS is down, too. And people looks at the agreement and say well, no one would have read that to mean that the United States included INS, because they were talking about a recommendation to INS. But when the government has written in, my view is that -- that the Third Circuit and the Fourth Circuit speak eloquently to that. But I don't see that that issue is presented here, given the context on which it arises in D.C. where this is conduct that should only be prosecuted in D.C. court by the United States. It was going to be the United States Attorney or a private prosecutor representing the United States.

And I think now all the parties agree, there is no constitutional requirement that the caption of the case actually say \"United States.\" So to the extent that answers the question about what does the plea agreement cover, we don't have a dispute about that. There's no constitutional reason why the court of appeals has to be reversed.

So if you at least get to that, then we say, well -- the judge looks at it and says, well, civil's not appropriate here because the violation is over; if I am going to punish this, it's going to have to be a determinant sentence, that's criminal. At that point, under this Court's cases, due process requires all sorts of things to protect the defendant. He gets a lawyer, or the other -- now, it would say, you don't have -- the Constitution doesn't require that there be a lawyer appointed to prosecute every one of these, or that would be my submission. So let the individual come in and file a motion. Let the court come in and look at it. Don't require a prosecutor to be appointed, interested or disinterested.

And again, we think -- you know, this case started out about a plea agreement. It's really a small case. We are now talking about these great big issues.

I think we wrote the word, you know, \"whoever stands in the well of the courtroom, it doesn't matter who that person is; that person represents the sovereign.\" That's the only constitutional way. If it's viewed that way, it's barred by the plea agreement. If it's not viewed that way, as the lower court construed the local statute to permit, then Gompers v. Buck's Stove does -- there is no authority there to impose a criminal penalty. We would ask the Court to reverse."
