In its first amended complaint, Great-West sought injunctive and declaratory relief prior to the time any of the funds were disbursed in this matter in the State court proceeding. It sought injunctive relief and other appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the employee benefit plan."

So, I -- you know, I take that to mean an injunction that is a normal equitable injunction, an injunction -- an injunction that is equitable relief.

Let's assume someone has signed a promissory note, and on the date the promissory note becomes due, the individual is entitled to an inheritance under a probate court decree. Would equity grant an injunction at the behest of the noteholder against using the inheritance for any purpose other than paying the note? I would have thought not.

If Congress decided in 502(a)(3) to permit fiduciaries to enforce the terms of a plan, they -- they cited in 502(a)(3)(A) the authority to seek injunctions to enforce the terms of the plan. It is clear that at common law injunctions were equitable in nature.

The district court denied that, and that case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit said we don't have jurisdiction because you're seeking money. And -- and our position is, first, we were seeking an injunction. That gave the Federal district court jurisdiction.

Krafka, which is -- which appears at page 29 of our -- of our brief, in the footnote 11 -- State courts have no jurisdiction to construe the terms of an ERISA plan except under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA which allows a participant to bring a claim for benefits. Now, if the participant had wanted, as the Court-appointed amicus brief argues that this should have all been decided in one court -- if the participant had wanted to have this decided in State court, they could have brought Great-West in by alleging a claim under 502(a)(1)(B). Now, the State court would have had concurrent jurisdiction. That is the only place in ERISA which gives State courts jurisdiction to construe the terms of a plan. Bearing that in mind, Justice O'Connor, if Great-West were to intervene, it would be asking the State court to construe the terms of the plan to determine the status of its restitution rights."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "May I just interrupt you? I'm not quite clear on that. Why do you have to construe the plan? It seems to me the plan is perfectly clear. You're enforcing the plan. You're not construing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDEN",
      "speech": "Well, I think, Your Honor, if you look at the -- at the district court's decision, which -- excuse me -- the State court decision, joint appendix 143, the State court makes very clear that it is in the process of making its decision reviewing -- it calls it the health insurance policy. It's not really that -- reviewing the terms of the plan and construing the terms of the plan for the purpose of determining what's the appropriate restitution, what's the appropriate reimbursement. Our position is the State court had no jurisdiction to do that unless they were doing so under a claim brought by the respondents under 502(a)(1)(B), in which case, of course, we could have removed that to Federal court. Not having done so, we also don't have a right to go into State court and ask the State court to construe that. Now, one of the reasons why 502(a)(3) has to give us a right to enforce the terms of the plan is because we know the beneficiary has a right to do that. Under 502(a)(1)(B), it can go into State court or Federal court and enforce the terms of a plan, including to get benefits and money. Second, we ought to be able to go into a Federal court and enforce the terms of the plan. And the fact that we get money shouldn't preclude us from doing that. And finally, Congress requires us to go in and enforce the terms of a plan under 404. And indeed, courts have uniformly said we're entitled to do that. For example -- a very clear contract case -- if an employer fails to make the contributions to a plan, where is the fiduciary going to get the authority to go and sue the employer? Under 502(a)(3)(A). That is where they go. So, there is no reason why -- Congress clearly intended under 502(a)(3)(A), when you're enforcing the terms of a plan, unlike as in Mertens where you were not enforcing the terms of a plan, where you were not enforcing the terms of a specific provision of ERISA, here it is clear that we should be entitled to enforce the terms of a plan even if that means preserving -- returning money to the plan."

There is a strong Federal policy in favor of some mechanism for enforcement of the term of the plan. Now, there's no -- Mertens teaches us there's no Federal action for damages based on a violation of the plan. There is no State law action for damages for a violation of the plan because this -- this is governed exclusively by Federal law. It involves the construction of a term of the plan. And indeed, if the plan were -- if the plan were to seek an action for damages or an injunction under State law, that would be deemed completely preempted by Federal law under -- under this Court's previous decisions.

Why then couldn't you say, but of course this isn't preempted, of course the right remedy is the State court remedy for damages, and of course in that situation Congress intended the plan to be able to sue to get their money back, and whatever interpretation is necessary by the State judge is fine? Why can't you say that?"

So, there's no question at all about resorting to a separate corpus of State law to interpret the plan. Second, Congress for various reasons said that the beneficiary could sue the plan in State -- in State court. It did not provide that the plan could sue the beneficiary in State court. ERISA is quite clear that that has to be in Federal court. There's exclusive -- exclusive jurisdiction over a civil action brought to enforce an action brought by a fiduciary for -- for the various kinds of equitable relief set forth in section 502(a)(3). So, for one, as is in the plan's shoes, it is equitable relief under ERISA or nothing. And that --"

The complaint does say for -- the complaint was framed when the money had not yet left Hyundai and was framed at that point in terms of a prohibitory injunction. It did ask for such other equitable relief as might be available. And there are classic forms of equitable relief that would be available, restitution, a constructive trust, or an equitable lien, which might -- any number of which might be applied in this case depending on who might be the appropriate defendant or what -- what theory or where the money is and so forth. Now --"

A prohibitory injunction would have very properly been issued by the district court to prevent the funds in the settlement from being disbursed in violation of the plan, which is how (a)(3)(A) is framed. And there is a res, by the way. It may not be money that came -- it may not be the exact same dollars that came from the plan, but the settlement check and the amounts that are derived from it are a res over which a constructive trust might properly issue. Another point about money coming from the plan. In Harris Trust, the case that the Court decided a couple of years ago, that was a claim -- an equitable claim for restitution. And the Court had no difficulty with concluding that such an equitable claim would lie. But I don't think anybody thought that Salomon Brothers, which had participated in the fiduciary breach -- I don't think anybody thought they were still holding the same dollars that they had obtained by participating in the breach of the fiduciary duty. I mean, it was -- it was a question of replacing those dollars, and that's -- and that's a proper application of the equitable remedy of restitution."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "I don't know how much. Liquidated damages -- I will make specific reference to another provision of 502, which is 502(g). The question -- Congress specifically dealt with the question of delinquent contributions by enacting section 515. It limited 515 to delinquent contributions from multi- employer plans and plans adopted pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. And then it said there's a specific remedy for that, 502(g)(2), which talks about legal relief. That expanded the universe of relief available for a particular kind of monetary issue which includes liquidated damages. But the limitations that Mertens I think correctly identified in 502(a)(3) -- namely, it's limited to equitable relief -- by its terms, carves out of the universe of remedies that our legal system has traditionally thought necessary one particular or one -- one subset of that relief and says this is all that's available. There are other circumstances ERISA by virtue of a broad but not universal preemption in which plan terms are not, in fact, remediable. When beneficiaries seek medical treatment to which they're guaranteed under the terms of a plan and don't get it in time before it becomes a moot point, those provisions become unenforceable. It's not unheard of in ERISA. Now, I do want to say that I think that the particular interest that we're talking about here, the plan's interest in recourse to recover money that ought to come from somebody else -- namely Hyundai, the third- party tortfeasor or alleged third-party tortfeasor -- I think need not be viewed as unavailable. I think that preemption law does not go so far as to rule out, in particular, the plan's suit as subrogee in State court, a plain, garden variety tort suit --"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "All right. Now, are we dealing with language in decisions that didn't focus on this circumstance? Because it's very hard for me to believe that Congress would not have wanted the plan to be able to sue people who owed them money including beneficiaries. After all, the purpose of ERISA is to protect the assets of the workers in plans. So, I'm -- I'm quite interested if you can say anything more about this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I do think that this Court's preemption decisions, from Pilot Life and some of its successors, have language in them that, taken all by themselves, might suggest that any contract cause of action on the same subject that is addressed in one of the ERISA remedial provisions would be preempted. Each of those cases, in fact, involved requests for greater relief than was made available, and that might well be a problem for the kind of contract action you're talking about here. If that relief is legal relief and it's covered by 502(a)(3) as a subject matter and Congress did not provide for it, there is a fairly strong inference that that kind of relief was relief that Congress did not want provided."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Now, which -- which would be the easier route? If I'm convinced that, of course, Congress wants the plan to be able to get its money back, legally now is it more proper to say it's not preempted the State court action, ordinary contract with attaching the assets? Or is it more legally correct to say there is no State court action; therefore, there is no adequate remedy at law; therefore, an action close to restitution or specific performance lies?"

    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I don't think that it, in the end, works to say that anytime equitable relief -- that anytime there's no legal relief, then there must be equitable relief because then I think we've erased the distinction Congress has meant -- has created. I do think the subrogation action presents a much easier case, indeed a case that ought to fall outside preemption law. It has not been the case under ERISA and it has not been the case under the Labor Management Relation Act section 301 provision that ERISA draws on that, as petitioners' counsel said, every suit involving interpretation of the plan is preempted, every State court suit. This Court, for example, in the Lingle decision, which I did not cite in -- in my brief, but Lingle against Magic Chef at the very end says plan interpretation -- or I guess collective bargaining agreement interpretation in the 301 context -- is something that State courts can do as an adjunct to a suit where the elements of liability and the duties are determined otherwise."

I think for purposes of this case in addressing the -- the concern about whether plans have recourse, a very narrow question is presented, and that is whether plan's tort suit against the alleged tortfeasor is preempted because not in determining whether the -- the third-party alleged tortfeasor violated a tort duty and is liable, not in determining the amount of -- of overall harm caused, but rather, in deciding whether the plan can be there as a plaintiff and what portion of any such recovery would belong to the plan, those essentially ancillary matters, which might require interpretation of the plan -- those, it seems to me, don't get preempted. And as long as those don't get preempted --"

There may be specific kinds of equitable relief that is -- that are requested that would fall under 502(a)(3). My -- my point is that there is no reason to distort what I think is the natural meaning of equitable relief based on an admittedly serious concern that a plan might not have recourse for money because I think the plan does have recourse for money through bearing the burden of pursuing that money against the tortfeasor, in which the interpretation of the plan is ancillary and -- and incidental just like at the very end of the Lingle against Magic Chef decision, which was then quoted and picked up again in the Livadas decision in 1994, in the labor contract context. State courts are entitled, despite a generally very broad preemption of the labor contract interpretation, to interpret labor contracts. So too with respect to the plan for this limited role for subrogation."

I don't want to talk about the other claims that you might have, but here where the plan insurance company says, here's this tort recovery, we want our piece of it, we want that restored, we want our advance restored to us, for that category of case, you're telling us you have a claim under Federal law that can be brought only in State courts."

      "speaker": "TARANTO",

What subrogation does, which I think ought to be a matter of Federal common law which probably just follows the terms of an ERISA plan, is say that the plan can step into the shoes of the beneficiary's rights under State law. And I do think that that mode of proceeding to find essentially a -- to find a recovery out of money that in justice, according to petitioners, ought to come from the third-party tortfeasor is available in State court.

And if, therefore, that contract action would be requesting relief that could only really be legal relief, there would be a much stronger preemption argument, a conflict preemption argument, that says Congress really did say we want equitable relief, we don't want legal relief, and that would be a stronger preemption --"

      "speaker": "TARANTO",

Perhaps as narrowing, but more importantly as clarifying what otherwise would, I think, be the more reasonable reading of (A), the enjoin clause, even if there were nothing else. I think the more reasonable reading would be injunctions as equity made them available. When I read -- what your first comment said, if all that was there was the enjoin language, I think that language by itself might be taken to mean enjoin any violation of the terms of the plan. I don't think that that would be the better reading even without the language that follows, but I think the language that follows compels adoption of that because it characterizes as equitable relief the injunctions provided for in the first clause."

I -- I have reviewed the -- the legislative history, the collective three-volume legislative history, and as I think some of this Court's decisions have -- have indicated, some of the earlier bills contained broader relief provisions, legal or equitable relief, and that was cut back for reasons that at least I don't recall having seen. In -- in the one reference to -- which I cited in -- in my brief I think at page 27 -- in one of the Senate reports that discusses the immediate predecessor of this provision, there's no general reference to any kind of relief that's necessary to -- to make plans protect all of their rights or vice versa. It's been principally a beneficiary protection statute. And there's also no general reference to restitution in the abstract. There's a reference to injunctions and specifically to constructive trusts. So, even there, there isn't a general idea that anytime we're talking about what sometimes are called direct damages or general damages or contractual damages, and therefore making whole the loser of a particular sum of money that's been promised, that that action would somehow be transformed into an equitable action when historically it very plainly wasn't."

I mean, Congress, one would assume, didn't want compensatory damages or punitive damages, and that's what they meant when they said appropriate equitable relief. But if back pay, which is fungible money, can be classified as equitable, why not this kind of restitution?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "Let me -- let me try to answer that -- that this way. This Court has never said that for the important constitutional question, that back pay is indeed equitable relief for Seventh Amendment purposes. It has several times said we are not deciding that and have not decided that. The courts of appeals have, for many years, in fact so held. But if you look back at the original decisions that so held back in the 1960's, they all rested on something that is suggested directly by the language of title 7, which is not that back pay standing alone is equitable and therefore outside the jury trial right, but that equity always had the power to award money when incidental to and intertwined with traditional equitable relief. In -- in the context of title 7, as in the context of the National Labor Relations Act on which title 7 was based, back pay enters not as a separately authorized remedy, but as reinstatement with or without back pay."

    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "And -- and I agree that the courts of appeals have, for a long time, treated that as outside the jury trial right, but this Court has never said so. And perhaps more importantly as a matter of congressional intent, there's no reason to think that Congress in 1974, when writing the ERISA provision, was adopting any specialized meaning of equitable relief that Congress may have had in mind in -- in the title 7 context."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, why wasn't there a reason given -- the limitations on the plan's ability to sue elsewhere? And as Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning suggests, it seems to me that if (A) and (B) are both going to do some work in the statute, that to insist that (A) simply embodies the historic definition of equity is -- is too narrow. And you can say that what Congress intended to do was to expand the injunctive power to analogs that are close to equitable actions here in accounting or instructions to a guardian or instructions to a trustee, it seems to me, is very close to historic equitable --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "But (B) -- (B) does quite definitely, as Harris Trust indicates, expand beyond injunctions the available relief. Because Harris Trust, after all, was a classic form of restitution where the money that was being sought was traceable. It, of course, doesn't have to be the very same money. It can be either money commingled with other funds or the product or profits from it, which are exactly the three things that this Court listed in -- in Harris Trust. That wouldn't, under any circumstance, be an injunction, but it would be a traditionally available form of equitable relief. But that doesn't mean that the whole of 502(a)(3), both (A) and (B), can reach beyond the limits that equity made -- set on the relief that the court of chancery would -- would make available."

      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "I -- I don't think so because, again, textually the two clauses are linked by the word other. And if it weren't the case, then again a plan could write a damages provision into its -- into itself and effectively turn (a)(3) into an authorization to get damages by saying we're just seeking, by enjoining the promised damages that you cause, an injunction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you're -- you're using the word other as -- as implying in (A) a limitation of (A) to only those instances in which a 1750 or whatever court of equity would have awarded an injunction. But isn't there another way of -- of giving some -- some meaning to other here? And that is to say that other was referring back to injunctions which (A) refers to simply as a generic form of relief. Everybody would agree. What -- what's an injunction? A legal remedy or equitable remedy? Sure, it's an equitable remedy. And the only thing that -- that other is referring to in (B) is the kinds of remedy. It doesn't necessarily imply that that kind of remedy, when awarded under (A), was a -- was a remedy only in those instances in which in the old law it could have been awarded. So, why isn't the -- the generic remedy meaning of other a satisfactory construction which then leaves the courts free to issue any kind of injunction under -- under (A) to enjoin a violation of the plan?"

    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I guess I -- I find the -- the much more natural reading of this provision in the context of (a)(2) which talks about equitable and other remedial relief and (g)(2) which talks about legal and equitable relief to be that Congress in (a)(3) said we want equitable relief available. And I -- I take it, at least, that a specific illustration of why it doesn't make much sense to separate those -- those apart even aside from what I think is the more natural textual point is that it would allow the plan again to write damages provisions into their terms, the plan's, and then come into court and say, we want an injunction for the beneficiary to pay us any damages that are caused by -- by some act because that's what --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but -- presumably, under -- under (A), under any injunction practice, the -- the court would require proof that there was need for an injunction in the first place. In other words, one couldn't simply come in and say, gee, they might violate it, so give us an injunction. But if one could make out a -- a case in the first instance for their need -- of a need for the injunction, that it seems to me would answer your concern that it could be -- that (A) thereby could be turned, in effect, through a plan provision into a general legal remedy."

In other words, the -- the very fact that Congress perhaps didn't -- didn't have that in mind, because it is so far-fetched, is a -- is a good reason to read (A) as -- as broadly as I'm suggesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "Well, I -- I guess I -- I would say that it's -- it is a better reason either to let Congress alter the statute if unanticipated problems have -- have arisen or, more immediately, to make sure that preemption law isn't taken to an extreme that precludes what I think is the more -- is the preferable solution anyway, which is that there is -- by the very terms of the plan, there's an intrinsic reference of this interest, of this right, to an underlying State court suit. It is preferable from a systemic point of view, from the point of view of avoiding the extra costs of duplicative litigation, of avoiding the potential conflict between Federal and State courts on either the very same or closely related questions for there to be a single, consolidated proceeding in which the entire question gets wrapped up who is supposed to get the single pot of money. There may be special reasons, as there was in this case, where the State court is probably uniquely entitled to create the special needs trust. There are good reasons for that consolidated State court proceeding to be the forum where the plan protects this interest, and preemption law I think very readily allows the plan to do that. As long as there is that outlet, perhaps even under Mertens, if there isn't that outlet, but as long as there is that outlet, then I think the more natural reading of 502(a)(3) should be respected."

      "speaker": "TARANTO",
      "speech": "Well, those -- I -- I agree that there is -- that there are certain gaps between Federal and State law that, in the beneficiary context, have become all but commonplace because there is an inference, which no court has yet figured a way to -- to supersede, the way Justice Breyer was talking about, that when beneficiary relief under (a)(1) is limited to benefits, it's not that Congress has, in effect, determined that damages that flow from violation of term plans to -- to provide necessary medical services are not available. If the Court has no further questions."
