Now, there was a record on that. Here, there is no record showing whether this aspect does or does not have the same tendency.

Aggregate limits combat corruption both by blocking circumvention of individual contribution limits and, equally, fundamentally, by serving as a bulwark against a campaign finance system dominated by massive individual contributions in which the dangers of quid pro quo corruption would be obvious and inherent and the corrosive appearance of corruption would be overwhelming. Now, the Appellants in this case have tried to present the case as though the issue were whether there were some corrupting potential in giving contribution to the nineteenth candidate after someone has already contributed to ­­ the maximum to the eighteenth. But that is not what this case is about. The Appellants are not arguing that the aggregate limit is drawn in the wrong place. They are arguing that there can be no aggregate limit because the base contribution limits do all the work. And so what that means is that you ­­ you're taking the lid off the aggregate contribution limit, and as Justice Kagan and her question earlier indicated, that means that an individual can contribute, every two years, up to $3.6 million to candidates for a party, party national committees and state committees ­­"

The current system, the way the anti­aggregation system works, is he's got to choose. Is he going to express his belief in environmental regulation by donating to more than nine people there?

It's a problem analogous to the one that was at issue with soft money in McConnell, which is the very fact of delivering a $3.6 million check to the ­­ whoever it is, the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, whoever it is who solicits that check, the very fact of delivering that check creates the inherent opportunity for quid pro quo corruption, exactly the kind of risk that the Court identified in Buckley, wholly apart from where that money goes after it's delivered.

There are apparently, from the Internet, 200 people in the United States who would like to give $117,000 or more. We're telling them, you can't; you can't support your beliefs. That is a First Amendment negative. But that tends to be justified on the other side by the First Amendment positive because, if the average person thinks that what he says, exercising his First Amendment rights, just can't have an impact through public opinion upon his representative, he says, what is the point of the First Amendment? And that's a First Amendment point. All right. So that's basic, I think. Now, once that's so, Congress has leeway. And you are saying ­­ and I have seen all over the place, that that's why we don't want those 200 people to spend more than 117­ or 120,000 because the average person thinks the election is ­­ after the election, all the actions are affected by the pocketbook and not by the merits of the First Amendment arguments.

And all that does is sort of mix up the messages because the parties can't control it. Now, that's, I think, the question that's being asked.

It's already addressed by all of the multiple prophylactic measures that BCRA contains. And to the extent those aren't sufficient, there are much narrower, tailored ways to get at this, as the questions from Justice Alito and the Chief Justice pointed out. What we're really hearing today is a corruption argument. But as the questioning revealed, once you accept the corruption theory that the Government is putting forward here, there really isn't a way to continue to draw a line between independent expenditures and the three­point million dollar check to all of these different individuals that is in small based limited amounts because there's certainly going to be just as much gratitude to the individual who spends $3.6 million directly supporting one candidate through ads on that candidate's behalf. So what we really have is a system that's forcing money out of the most transparent way possible to make contributions which is directly to the candidates and the parties and the PACs.
