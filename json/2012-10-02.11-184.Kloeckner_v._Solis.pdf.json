The second sentence of 7703(b)(2) on which the Government relies is a statute of limitations, and it doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts. That subsection is set out at pages 16a to 17a of the Government's brief. The first sentence provides that for a described category of cases, they are to be, quote, \"filed under one of the listed Federal antidiscrimination statutes.\" As this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of those are statutes which authorize jurisdiction and claims in district courts. Indeed, in Title VII and the ADEA, that is the only Federal court which is authorized to hear the cases."

Your question, I take it, is about the former. Our view is that the claim is filed and pled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a discrimination case; in this case, under several different statutes. And the complaint here reads very much like an ordinary discrimination complaint. The Government may raise the -- that sort of procedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would be free to do so here. And that -- that happens on a number of occasions. For example, if there were a case in which the Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations, appealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt of the agency decision, the Government could move to dismiss that claim on what the lower courts call exhaustion grounds.

As this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown v. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the Court's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary to exhaust were not clear. So the regime established by Section 717 of Title VII, which was adopted in 1972, sets up an exhaustion requirement which is clear, simple and limited in time. It requires the plaintiff to file a complaint, wait at that point 180 days, and at that point, the plaintiff was done and could go to district court. Plaintiff also had the option at that point of going to the Civil Service Commission, waiting 180 days. But as long as a timely complaint was filed, that was all that was required of the plaintiff. And that was a fundamental change in the way this had been dealt with. The ADEA regime, which was adopted in 1974, was actually even simpler, although it's been changed a little bit since. The plaintiff to exhaust had to do only one of two things, either file a complaint with the EEOC, period, or give the EEOC notice that the plaintiff was going to sue and wait 30 days. As the Government pointed out in its brief in Stevens, the exhaustion regime under the ADEA hadn't -- didn't in any way address what happened after the complaint was filed. It simply said, file the complaint. That is the fundamental principle that's animated the Title VII exhaustion requirement in Title VII and the ADEA, and we don't think the CSRA was written to change that. Indeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it doesn't do so expressly -- it incorporates by reference those statutes; it expressly reiterates the de novo exhaustion requirement. It actually shortened the period of time that plaintiff has to wait for these cases."

If the plaintiff were to abandon the discrimination claim, then the case would have to go to the Federal Circuit. That's the way the courts have interpreted that."

It says \"cases of discrimination.\" And if you look at section 7702, which is set out at page 8(a) of the Government's brief, it describes the cases involved as cases which contain these two elements.

It's changing it from 90 days in Title VII to 30 days. So when Congress wanted to change something, it was very specific.

The first one is if jurisdictional issues went to the Federal circuit you would have an -- a really bizarre problem of -- of splitting the claim, and here's why: If, under the EEOC regulations which the Government has referred to, if the MSPB holds that it didn't have jurisdiction in a mixed case, the discrimination claim doesn't die. Under the regulations it goes back to the agency, which then processes it as a non-mixed case. But the plaintiff is still free to challenge the decision of the MSPB that it had no jurisdiction. In the Government's view, that would go to the Federal circuit. So the case would then be pending in two different places. And if the plaintiff came to the end of the line in the -- at the agency level and lost, the plaintiff clearly would go to district court. So the case would then be pending in two different places. On our view, everything goes to the district court."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "I agree that there is no basis for the distinction and part of that is because, as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC regulation providing that when the board dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district court. So if the whole point is to find a way for an employee to get into district court on her discrimination claim, we've already had that taken care of in jurisdictional dismissal cases. So the action really here is with procedural dismissals. And if -- I would like to start with Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there has been a repeal of the right to go to district court on discrimination claims. And I think our starting point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is 28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit. This court is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the only exception to that is for the subset of final board decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2). And if you look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board decision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section 7702. Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase is only ever used either in or in reference to section 7702."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Now, does that mean that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is thrown out on a procedural ground."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "It means that it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "Why is that? I mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural objections all the time and we think of those as judicially reviewable. It's -- it's a real stretch to say simply because it says \"judicially reviewable\" it means judicially reviewable on the merits."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "Well, in our view, again, because it uses the phrase \"judicially reviewable action\" under 7702 and that phrase \"judicially reviewable action\" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this context. So although dismissal on procedural grounds is a board action subject to judicial review, in our view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702. And so you need to look at 7702 to see how --"

The first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases where this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl and Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has interpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it exists today directs review of board decisions to the Federal Circuit. But the second answer is, even for that brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken away jurisdiction from district courts over board decisions and had directed them to the courts of appeals. And this Court recognized in Fausto that that -- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted the CSRA. It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction in all the district courts throughout the country over Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a layer of review and direct them to fewer courts. Now --"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "I disagree, Your Honor. I mean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would indicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB final decisions reviewed in district court.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
      "speech": "But, Ms. Harrington, go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you, because the question was: Should we read \"judicially reviewable action\" as something different from action subject to judicial review, which is how you would normally read that language, as something different from just final agency action that you can take to a court. Not saying which court, that you can just take to a court. And you're asking us -- you said it's a term of art. So I guess the next question is: How do you get the definition of the term of art that you say exists in this statute?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "Well, you look at 7702, and let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702. That's in the text of 7703(b)(2)."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE KAGAN",
      "speech": "But you say no, it really, you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that it's really a switch as to which court you get to take the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to read this language. So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you find the definition of the term of art? And I think what your answer is going to be is this notion the board shall decide the issue of discrimination and the applicable action; is that correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "Yes. Can I just take you back one sentence to say, the point is not just that the board is done, the point is that the board is done under 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702, and so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that provision Congress specifies various points at which a final board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially reviewable action. The one that's relevant in this case is in subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of the page there. It says: \"Any decision of the board under paragraph (1)\" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- \"of this subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action, either when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek EEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case.\" So in our view there are two indications in (a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the issue of discrimination in order to be a judicially reviewable action -- action under section 7702."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
      "speech": "Why doesn't the language that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the board within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action, not that it must actually adjudicate those two issues? What if you have a threshold, you have a threshold timeliness issue that is completely dispositive? You're saying that this language means the board nevertheless has to decide the merits of the discrimination issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "No. I'm glad you asked that question. The directive in section -- that you're referring to is at the bottom of page 8a. The directive is that the board shall decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the board's appellate procedures. In this case the board complied with that directive by not deciding the issue of discrimination because the appeal was untimely. And I know that sounds a little strange when I first say it, so let me give you an analogous example. Imagine a State law that directed the DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in accordance -- in accordance with the procedures governing such applications. If the DMV required that driver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit to an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have to issue a license to someone who refused to comply with those requirements. In that case the DMV would comply with the directive that it issue a license in accordance with its procedures by not issuing a license at all. And it's the same thing here. Here the board complied with the directive that it decide the issue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate procedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination and therefore not issuing a decision under 7703."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

I mean, look, it says in (a), it says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely, and then it says \"alleges that the basis for the action was discrimination,\" okay. In that case the board shall within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action. So they decided it. They decided it was out of time. They decided it was barred. They decided da, da, da. I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an issue that a person raises in court and we don't normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court. It decided it. It decided it was untimely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",

I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide the merits or you could read it as saying, there could be several claims that went on below. Heard them, decide the discrimination one. Now, you decide the discrimination one. And I agree they used the word \"issue\" instead of saying decide the discrimination claim, that it says here, he alleges. They could have said, decide the allegation. They could have said, decide that part of the case. But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14 hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a new jurisprudence arising. Is the dismissal on the ground that it was an allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to really make out discrimination? It was partial summary judgment. It was a dismissal on the basis of the statement in the complaint. It was -- I mean, we can think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural, jurisdictional or on the merits. And why do we want to get courts into that, when the simplest thing is the person says, I allege discrimination. There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of his paper. The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on that particular one, and now we go to the district court. That's just so simple."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
      "speech": "Oh, no, no. All we're doing is interpreting what you've said is the word issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he has raised that he was discriminated against."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "But what we're trying to do is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions. In our view, its choice of the word issue is important, because it's not just deciding the case that alleges discrimination. It's the issue of discrimination."

There's another hint in paragraph (a)(3), and let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the direction to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3), another hint that Congress was really talking about cases where the board decides the issue of discrimination. In paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a), Congress provides that a judicially reviewable action becomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when the employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or when the EEOC decides not to take the case. Now, the only types of decisions from the board that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach an issue of discrimination. And so it would be strange to be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC could review if you're talking about decisions that don't involve the issue of discrimination."

I mean, if Congress were really saying we don't want procedural determinations to go to the district court, that's a very easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send you -- you know, involve six different cross-references and unnatural reading of statutory language. And, you know, in the end, your argument just is based on this notion that Congress used the word decide rather than dispose of in this single provision. The argument would completely collapse if that were not the case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in this extremely complicated and backhanded way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "speech": "I mean, I'm not going to resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated. I mean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they have remarked about how it is a complex statutory scheme. But I think Congress did accomplish in a pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal circuit, and it did that by making that the background rule. In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2). And then the question is, well, which of those decisions fall within (b)(2). In our view, you should not read that exception more broadly than necessary to accommodate employees' rights to have their discrimination claims determined de novo in district court. Here, the board decision, it decided two things. First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board timely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her untimeliness. There is no reason to think that Congress would have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal circuit. The whole point of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified body of law governing certain things in the country that Congress really thought should be directed to one place, and that included board decisions."

      "speech": "It is -- it is true that a small range of procedural issues governing the board's procedures might be heard in district court, but it is truly a very small universe of issues bordering on non-existent, and let me explain why. As suggested here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a defense of exhaustion. But then generally speaking it would have to be a procedural issue that the Government, that the agency raised before the board and the board rejected. Now, the board's own regulations allow the board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory requirements, including timeliness, for good cause. And so the Government would have to argue in the district court that essentially the board abused its discretion by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very many cases in which that's going to come up, where the Government's going to make that kind of argument. So although there's -- there's potential, there's a potential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under our view, it is really a small universe of issues that could go to district court."

The latter way favors your opponent, the former favors you; okay. So we could do either, I guess. The one way, if you win, there will be a body of law about what counts as procedural and what doesn't. That sounds confusing to me. If you lose, I quite agree with you that there will then be different courts deciding different procedural matters, where you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit. Okay.

Under your reading both should be given identical meaning, because they both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, we shouldn't have that absurd result."

And so it wouldn't make sense to apply the escape hatch to cases in that situation."

The district court construed this case as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking review of the agency's decision. Petitioner did not challenge that district court holding before the eighth circuit in her opening brief. She didn't flag that as issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case -- this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's seeking review of the agency decision instead of the board decision, in our view that's not really a question that is presented in -- in the case any longer. In our view she is seeking review over the board decision, the board decision decided that her appeal was untimely, that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness. There is no indication anywhere in the statute that Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal Circuit. And so in our view it does not fall within -- in the exception to exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction provided in (b)(2) because it does not decide the issue of discrimination.

      "speech": "I -- I am happy to do so, Your Honor. You pointed out that -- that where subject matter jurisdiction is concerned, is it important that rules be clear? And you asked counsel for Respondent, why was Respondent's rule clearer than the Petitioner's rule? In this case our rule is demonstrably clearer. The question is which mixed-cases go to the district court? Our answer is all. The Government's answer, the rule that is derived from Ballentine, has confounded the lower courts since Ballentine and those problems are reflected in the divergent accounts of the rule in the Government's brief. There are more than half a dozen of these problems. First, the courts are divided below, as is the Government's brief, about whether the Government's rule applies to all procedural issues or only to procedural issues that arise before the court reaches the merits. For example, in -- in Hopkins v. MSPB, after the court had resolved the merits, there was a dispute about counsel fees and an argument that the counsel fee application was untimely. The Government took the position that that timeliness issue belonged in the district court. Secondly, the lower courts are divided as is the Government's brief about whether a procedural issue that is related to or intertwined with the merits goes to the district court or the court of appeals. There is a line of cases holding that a -- a -- when the MSPB holds there is no jurisdiction because the discrimination claim is frivolous, that's a procedural jurisdiction issue, it's not a merits issue. And if you look at the opinion in Hill v. Department of the Air Force, you see a lengthy description of Title VII law, in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, in the course of a decision by the Federal Circuit holding there is no jurisdiction. Third, it is unclear what constitutes the line between a merits decision and a procedural decision issue. Some things are really neither. For example, there are recurring disputes about whether a settlement was voluntary. Well, it's not the merits of the discrimination case, but it's not procedural in any normal sense of the word. Fourth, there are cases which involve several claims resolved on several different bases. We noted some of them in our reply brief. One -- one claim was rejected on jurisdictional grounds; one claim was rejected on res judicata and one claim was decided by the board on the merits. It's unclear how that would go. There are also situations in which two cases get filed, one of which -- and they are related cases, and they go to the same judge, and one -- one involved an MSPB decision on procedural grounds, one on the merits. The court in that case just thought it ought to just keep them both. It's not clear how that comes out. Fourth -- some, sorry, fifth."

I know where that goes. There is also a problem, which the briefs address, about factual disputes that arise with regard to jurisdiction or procedure. The -- 7703(c) says, \"Questions of fact get decided de novo.\" What does that mean? If there -- let's take, for example, a case in which the claim is that a charge wasn't filed on time with the agency. That's a question of fact. The agency might find that it was timely -- there could be a dispute of fact about when the violation occurred which triggers the limitation period. The agency would make a finding of fact. The MSPB might affirm that finding. The Government tells us they would affirm whatever the agency did. The statute seems to say that's got to be decided de novo, the Federal circuit can't do that.
