Historically present value has been an objective concept equalling the real interest rate and inflation, which is the time value of money. The Seventh Circuit has redefined this concept in a manner that seriously disrupts two fundamental principles of chapter 13, that being the equal treatment of creditors similarly situated and the debtor's rehabilitation, the debtor's access to chapter 13."

I frankly don't see how yours is much different because you add a premium to the prime rate. What is that premium going to be? Why shouldn't it depend on the transaction? Why shouldn't it depend on the risk of default? Why doesn't your approach have all of the same problems as the coerced loan approach?"

It would cost him 21 percent because he's a high-risk borrower. That's -- that's the theory.

In that 21 percent contract rate, first of all, on the record in this case the expert couldn't even say what it consisted of. But in your typical contract rate of interest, you're going to have transaction charges. You're going to have the risk of default, which has already occurred here, the risk of bankruptcy default, for instance. That risk has already occurred here.

      "speech": "Let -- let me ask you a -- the -- the way I see these two approaches. I'm assuming that -- that you're -- you're willing to allow over the prime rate some addition which the -- the courts that -- that follow your -- your favored approach do allow for risk factor. So under your theory, you take the prime rate, and then it is up to the bankruptcy judge to assess what the risk is, something that I think judges are probably not very well qualified to do. You know when -- when you pick the prime rate, that that's not the market rate. It obviously isn't. So it's well below the market rate. I mean, here you had a 21 percent loan and you're going to take what? I don't know. A prime rate of 8 percent at most? You know it's wrong. And then the bankruptcy judge has to make it right. Okay? Under the other approach, you take the market rate, the rate that was actually adopted between these -- these two people operating in a free market. Now, it -- it may be -- may be high, it may be low. You don't know for sure that it's either one. It's -- it's -- it may be accurate. It is not surely inaccurate the way picking the prime is. And then the adjustment to be made by the bankruptcy judge is much less. If there are some special factors that show a lesser risk now than there was when the loan was originally made, he might take them into account. Now, as I see it, the less discretion that is left to the bankruptcy judge and the more weight that is given to the -- to the real forces of the operating market, the better off we are. I -- I don't think that bankruptcy judges are very good risk calculators."

The -- Justice Scalia said to give this kind of you- pick-it discretion to the bankruptcy judge is a worrisome thing, but all of the cases that take this approach, the Treasury bill approach or the prime, seem to have a rather narrow range for that risk factor.

Now, that approach is mistaken, we submit, for three principal reasons. First, it violates the core bankruptcy principle of equality of distribution for similarly situated creditors. Under the court of appeals' approach, two creditors could make car loans to the same debtor that resulted in allowed secured claims of equal value, and yet one would receive thousands more in plan payments solely because the other made its car loan at a time when the debtor's financial troubles had not yet become obvious."

    {
      "speaker": "SALMONS",
      "speech": "Your Honor, this is an important point because I think there is some misconception about what the court of appeals held in this case, and I think that's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least as I read their position, are not really defending the approach taken by the court of appeals. The court of appeals did not adopt a presumption in favor of the pre- bankruptcy contract rate because it thought that that represented accurately the relevant market, if you will, for the risks of -- and benefits and protections that exist under the Bankruptcy Code. In fact, under the court of appeals' approach, the risk of nonpayment is really irrelevant. What the court of appeals says is that because the -- the creditor is denied use of funds for the period of the payment plan, that it therefore is entitled to whatever rate it would have gone out and funded a new loan at if it had been allowed to foreclose and reinvest the proceeds. Now --"

      "speaker": "SALMONS",
      "speech": "That's correct, and I just want to emphasize, though, that -- that the adjustment that the court of appeals would make is not one I think that anybody before the Court now would defend because the court of appeals would adjust only if you could prove that the -- a particular secured creditor is now making loans at some other rate and there's no reason to think why that has anything to do with what the present value of plan payments would be under 1325.

You could have a 0 percent lender. You could have a prime lender, and you could have a subprime lender.

They would be separately classified. Because their risks are different, the interest rates are different. In this very case at page 12 of the joint appendix, you can see how the debtor broke down its four secured creditors into four separate categories, and they have different rates. Two secured creditors are offered 9.5 percent and two are offered 0 percent interest for the payments the debtor is going to make.

And what we see happening is that in those situations where the bankruptcy courts are applying the formula approach, they are systematically giving chapter 13 debtors a rate of interest pretty close to prime.

On the other hand, if the creditor wants to come in and give a -- present his evidence, the contract, of how risky this person is, then in fact it is evidence absolutely. And the bankruptcy judge will look at it, and he'll try to figure out the pluses and the minuses, what's happened to the interest rate, whether this particular person is a good or bad risk, and he'll choose a number.

If you have a default, the secured party has to come back to the bankruptcy court, hire an attorney, pay a $75 filing fee, argue the case.

And the example in 1325(a)(5)(B) that we're talking about is simply an example of indubitable equivalence. The secured party must be fully compensated for the risk that it must assume.

And it's important to understand just after this Court's decision in Rash set the valuation standard for setting the principal amount, what you see now is that since we got the standard right, in 99 percent of the cases, the parties come to an agreement as to what the value of the collateral is. Once we get the standard right here, you should expect the same thing. It won't be litigated over and over again. The correct standard is I think to recognize, which I think Your Honor does, that this concept of present value is an economic concept, not an equitable one, and that essentially what we're doing is we're saying there is a stream of payments to be made here and we have to figure out what it's worth. The best test for what it's worth would be what the market says. Now, the problem is, is that in chapter 11 there is a market. People do lend to chapter 11 debtors, and the standard is the same in chapter 11 as 13: value as of the effective date of the plan under 1129. So what we -- we have to be very careful about is in chapter 11, the markets do value debtors' promises to pay and they lend money and they charge very high interest rates. Exit lenders or finance lenders charge very high interest rates, 18, 19, 20 percent. It can't be true that in bankruptcy, in chapter 13, who are the riskiest chapter -- riskiest debtors with the highest default rate, that we systematically give them a rate which approaches prime. So I think what you need to do, recognizing it's an economic concept, is say what's the best evidence of a market rate."

So if the debtor defaults under the plan, someone has to go back to court and say, I need relief. I need relief from the automatic stay to exercise my collection rights. A corporation like SCS can't go back to court pro se. It needs a lawyer. You have to hire somebody to go and represent them. You have to pay a filing fee. Oftentimes the bankruptcy judge gives the debtor a second chance to cure the default under the plan. Then the debtor says I'll cure, and then you come back a second time, sometimes a third time, sometimes a fourth time, sometimes a fifth time, incurring costs at each juncture.

But -- but then put the burden back on you to produce some real evidence and statistics about what happens to people we don't know about. Now, who are those people? We agree they've gone into bankruptcy, so they're risky, but they're also trying to get a second chance, and they also want to keep things like the truck because it will help them in their business. And the bankruptcy judge has sat there and looked them in the eye. And you have all those things about it which you don't have about the people you're giving the 21 percent to which is a great mass of undifferentiated people.

We do know that the best evidence of a market rate for these particular class of borrowers is the contract rate.

The interest that they got before bankruptcy is another. The transaction cost that they're saved, another. And so let the debtor come in and show that. But the debtor has no money at all and certainly you don't want the debtor's money eaten up hiring an attorney and further depleting the money that could go to the creditors. So it seems to me wildly unrealistic to expect that if you say the presumptive price is the contract price, you're going to get a debtor who will be able to -- I mean, I was surprised, looking at this record, that this debtor got an expert. Who -- who paid the expert? Maybe because the union was involved?"

      "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
      "speech": "No. They often have lawyers, Your Honor. But let me suggest this. If the Court were to set the rate at the presumptive -- the contract rate as the presumptive rate, this is what would happen and this is what has happened in circuits where that is so. The -- the contract rate becomes the presumptive rate, and in most cases the debtor will offer that in its plan -- in his or her plan as the appropriate rate. If the debtor doesn't like that, we'll offer less of a rate and then what happens is a negotiation. And the debtor and the secured party get together and they negotiate based upon the debtor's presentation of this is why I think it should be adjusted off of that because my circumstances have improved or there's a lot of equity in this particular collateral, so your risks are less, so you're more protected. And those various reasons can then be given, and then the parties can negotiate. If, however, you set a standard where the bankruptcy court is just simply going to decide based upon the evidence that the parties put in, we're not going to adopt the formula approach, then you'll be back to the problem where we are before, lots of litigation. Again, because the contract rate is the best evidence of a -- of a market rate between these parties, it should be the presumptive rate and we should work from that."

What the Court said in Rash that the parties had to do was the debtor had to go out -- the debtor already has the truck -- had the truck in Rash -- is go out and see what it would have cost the debtor to replace that truck. It didn't actually do it, but simply say what would it have cost. The same principle applies here. The debtor should actually go out and see what would someone pay. How much would someone charge to finance this debtor's loan?"

Now, the whole purpose of the value requirement and the indubitable equivalent concept and the whole cramdown standard is to make sure the secured party doesn't -- isn't shouldered with uncompensated risk. So the question becomes what's best method of compensating the secured party for its risk. And the statute, because of what it requires, value as of the effective date of the plan using an economic concept, says we basically have to value the stream of payments. Nobody really is willing to say I would give this debtor $4,000 or take this debtor's promise of payment of $4,000 at -- at a prime rate or anything close to a prime rate. Again, the contract date is the best evidence of a market valuation that we have. And so that's what I think we have to work with --"

They actually paid the contract off early, but we need to start with as pure a base as possible and then if there are special circumstances, sure, the bankruptcy court could have discretion to add on if there is particular jeopardy to the property. But we're measuring two different things here. The -- the statute doesn't say contract. The statute doesn't say market rate. This market rate concept has been misabused. And it -- right now under the bankruptcy court's interpretation anything is okay as long as you put this market rate label on it, and that's not a proper standard for chapter 13 confirmation. The other problem is with the respondent's approach, the respondent uses words out of the Bankruptcy Act, pre-Bankruptcy Act, that simply were never enacted under chapter 13. Full compensation, full value of their rights. That's nowhere in chapter 13. It's not a part of the chapter 13 requirements. Indubitable equivalence. That's not a chapter 13 confirmation concept. That's a -- that's a concept that was brought in to confuse this issue, but it is not chapter 13.
