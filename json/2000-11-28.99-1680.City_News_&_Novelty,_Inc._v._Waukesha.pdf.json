      "speech": "Not in this case. We will do that in some future case, but we have not made that argument in this case and we don't think the Court should reach that argument in this case. This is a case about procedures, not about the substantive disqualification criteria."

If it applies to everybody, as all those building code requirements do as far as I know, then they're not subject to the Freedman guarantees, and that's what the Court said in Lakewood. The second principle that I think controls the Court's disposition of this case is that a speech licensing scheme violates the First Amendment if it permits the status quo to be altered to the applicant's detriment during the administrative proceedings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "How do you get that from Freedman, because Freedman, the status quo was no speech. That is, the Court said you must have a graphic procedure, because you're not allowing someone to speak. Here, a speaker has been permitted to speak, has a license, and the question is whether it will be renewed. So --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "That's absolutely correct. In Freedman and in Southeastern Promotions the Court said that a prior restraint before judicial review can be imposed only where it maintains the status quo. Where the status quo is speech, obviously you can't impose a prior restraint prior to judicial review, and in the tail-end of Southeastern Promotions the Court listed the constitutional deficiencies with the law at issue there, and one of the deficiencies listed was that it permitted the status quo to be altered to the applicant's detriment before judicial review."

    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "It was a new speech case, that's correct, but I believe the Court found that the status quo was altered to the applicant's detriment because the show in the presentation of Hair in Southeastern Promotions had to be postponed and they lost their date for the presentation. We believe that the third principle governing this case is that a licensing scheme that acts as a prior restraint must confer upon an unsuccessful applicant the right to prompt judicial review, and the fourth principle is that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Do you really -- is that really your principle? As I understand your case, it's not prompt judicial review as such, as was the case in Freedman, but here you would be delighted to have delayed judicial review as long as you keep your license until judicial review is over, so what you're really saying, it's not a question of prompt, it's a question of until the end of the judicial road, however long that road is, your license can't be revoked."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "We believe that's what Southeastern Promotions requires, and we believe that's the only way to prevent injury from lack of prompt judicial review."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But then if that's the case it's nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review. It's simply that you retain your license until judicial review is over, however long it takes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "It's right that that's the rule we're urging the Court to find in Southeastern Promotions and FW/PBS and apply in this case, but it's wrong to say that it has nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review, I think, because the question on which the Court granted certiorari is does the licensing ordinance have to contain language to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review, and the only way to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review when you're enacting city licensing ordinance is to maintain the status quo, guarantee the status quo --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that can be done by the court. If that's constitutionally required, as you say, when you have the ordinance providing for prompt commencement of judicial review, what would go along with the prompt commencement of judicial review is the ability of the court, indeed the obligation of the court, if the Constitution is as you say it is, to immediately issue a stay order preventing the cancellation of the license. Why isn't that sufficient? Why does it have to be in the statute if you provide for judicial review and if, as you tell us, the court having judicial review must maintain the status quo?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Justice Scalia, it's not sufficient for five reasons. First, the timing of that sort of temporary relief is in the discretion of the circuit court and can depend on lots of factors, including docket pressure --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Not if it's constitutionally required, as you tell us. You tell us that the status quo has to be maintained. If that's so, you have a -- you know, a lock on a stay order from the court as soon as the case gets there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Well, that really depends on what this Court says in this case. If the Court says in this case, as we urge it to say, that the status quo through judicial review must be guaranteed, then I suppose we could go into circuit court and get on the schedule for a motion and have the judge receive briefs and decide our motion and, after a period of time, issue an order implementing this Court's decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "No."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I mean, why should we pronounce that advisory opinion? If it is indeed the case, as you say it is, that the court must issue a stay order, why can't we await that event? If and when a court doesn't issue a stay order, then you've been harmed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "I don't think that a stay order, the possibility of a stay order in the circuit court is an adequate substitute for Freedman safeguards, including maintenance of the status quo as written into the ordinance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, the supreme court of Wisconsin held -- was it the supreme court, or the court of appeals?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, couldn't you argue that the administrative determination by the city was arbitrary or capricious? Isn't that a ground for judicial review of an administrative order?"

    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "We could. That would be an argument going to the merits of the claim and, of course, it would be relevant to the issuance of a stay, because we have to show probability of success."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Your position basically is, even though your claim substantively has no merit, you're still entitled to an automatic stay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "I don't even get to whether we're entitled to an automatic stay in my thinking, because I don't think that the possibility of a stay being imposed in a discretionary manner in the circuit court is sufficient to satisfy Southeastern Promotions, Freedman,"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It is sufficient if they decide your case -- if the circuit -- you have some claim on the merits. You say they're arbitrary in taking away my license."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, all right, you say this, we have a claim on the merits, and you say, judge, decide it. Decide it before we have to close down. Now, if they do, it's fine, right? You have no complaint as long as the judge decides your claim on the merits before you have to shut the door."
    },

      "speaker": "OLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Fine, then why aren't you better off, not worse off, if the court decides a stay before you have to shut down, for after all, a court will give you the stay as long as there's a reasonable probability of success, but the court will allow you to stay open on the merits only if you're right."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Not -- not really, in terms of timing especially. We can't show a reasonable probability of success on the merits in an administrative review until that administrative record gets to the court, and there's no time limit on that under the unamended ordinance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "This case has an air of unreality to it, because in fact your client did get a stay until the end of the judicial road without making a showing of probability of success on the merits and, in fact, the entire case has been now adjudicated on the merits, is that not so?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "That's correct, and we have no as- applied challenge here. This is strictly a facial challenge case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "Why isn't the case moot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",

      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Well, there's no showing that they intend to engage in this business, or that they have not applied for a new license and they don't have an application pending now, but they haven't foresworn any intention to apply for a license at some other location in the future."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Yes. The City News and Novelty is footing the bill for this case because they believe they're right, they believe in it's important principle, and they don't want the 5-year disability from licensure that will fall on the corporation and its officers. If they're determined to have been operating without a license in violation of a valid ordinance up until February 14, 2000, which is when they stopped operating as an adult book store, they'd be disabled from licensure in Waukesha for 5 years after that, until Valentine's Day 2005."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That disability has nothing -- I mean, that disability has something to do with a defect in the system that might have produced a merits decision that was contrary to the facts, or contrary to the law, but I don't see how that disability has anything to do with the question of timing that you're now bringing before us. I mean, if, indeed, your client was properly found to be in violation of the substantive provisions of the ordinance, then it seems to me he deserves to be disabled from future licensing. What does that have anything to do with the timing question of, you know, he has to be allowed to continue operation before the adjudication is made? I mean, I see that you have some continuing interest, but it's not an interest that depends at all upon the issue that you're bringing before us here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLSON",
      "speech": "Justice Scalia, they do in the following sense. If there is no valid judicial review path in this licensing ordinance, then there's no valid renewal mechanism, and the whole licensing requirement becomes facially invalid. Then they're entitled to operate without a license."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you're not saying that the whole judicial review mechanism is invalid in the sense that it has produced an unjust or incorrect substantive decision. You're saying that there's one feature of it, namely whether your client was allowed to operate in the meantime that rendered it unfair, but I don't see how that has anything to do with your -- the propriety of preventing your client from operating in the future, once a substantive violation has properly been found. Or, you say it can't properly be found, that the entire judicial proceeding is invalidated by reason of the fact that your client could not be allowed to continue operation pending the proceeding?"
    },

Then you have no constitutional right that has been violated."

I think if we were making an as-applied challenge the -- Justice Scalia would be right in the sense that we haven't suffered any injury, because we were allowed to remain open. The fact that we're making a facial challenge, I think first of all it focuses the Court's attention on the ordinance as it stood in 1995, and that's -- in '96, and that it prevents it from being mooted out by the subsequent amendments to the ordinance that have taken place four times this year."

But here your client is in exactly the same position as the other people, and should that make a difference? One reason why it might make a difference is, if it turns out that this supposedly facially invalid ordinance in practice is applied in a perfectly valid way to you, should we therefore assume that it will be different when the ordinance is applied to third parties?"

The City of Waukesha maintains that a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination, as required in Freedman in the context of a censorship scheme, is neither applicable or required for a licensing ordinance that focuses on the secondary effects of such establishments and targets prior misconduct not protected by the Constitution. The specific issue before this Court, which is before the Court today, is that -- whether such an ordinance, which has neither the effect or purpose of limiting or restricting the content of any commutative materials must provide either a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination, versus the availability or access to prompt judicial review for administrative decisions that are made concerning conduct which is unprotected by the First Amendment."

This Court has stated, to obviate the risks associated with that the judiciary has the expertise to make determinations concerning the constitutionality or whether a matter is protected or unprotected. That is clear, that an administrative review body is not the final arbiter. If they want to declare something obscene or not, the burden is upon them -- the burden upon them of going to court and proving that is there, and the requirement of prompt judicial determination is because the judiciary has the necessary sensitivity towards what is protected or not protected versus an administrative body."

It's not addressed at all business, just radio stations. It picks them out, and it addresses the external effects of radio stations. If they're found to be in violation of the sanitary code because they're infested with rats, or because the plumbing is unsafe, or because the electricity is unsafe, their license can be revoked. It seems to me a very parallel situation.

I think there are differences in a due process analysis between someone who has applied for renewal of a license and hasn't gotten the renewal and has a property interest, perhaps, in that license, and that may have due process implications, but I think from the standpoint of the First Amendment the question is, is there going to be a period of time during which the expression doesn't occur, or does occur, and it's just an interest in expression, and it doesn't matter whether before that time the person was licensed and had -- expression occurred or not."

There can be a period of time in this case pending judicial review, as long as the judicial review is available, during which the expression doesn't occur. I think what's necessary in this context is, the license applicant has to have the availability of -- has to be able to go immediately into court once the administrative decision is made, the licensee has to have the ability to get temporary or preliminary relief if the facts of the case warrant it, and there has to be no particular obstacles that are placed in the licensee's way, and if all of that is satisfied, then the court is in the position to safeguard the licensee's interest and no further requirements are necessary."

I do think that on the merits the important -- the crucial point here is that the decisions the city makes are not content-based. Unlike in a situation like Freedman, where the Court said, this Court said that a reviewing court has to be able -- has to -- is necessary, because what the State was doing was looking at the particular movie and making a judgment based on that content about whether that movie should be allowed."

You can let the other party go to court and the city doesn't have to bear the burden of proof when it goes to court, and I think the point of that decision was that the municipal decision here, since it's not content-based, can be allowed to go into effect and have final effect even with no judge ever looking at it. In the Freedman context, it's quite different. In the Freedman context, what the Court was saying, we don't want this censor's decision to go into effect for any significant period of time without a judge looking at it. It's not really a final determination of law until you go into court, until a judge has a chance to look at it and decide whether the material --"

      "speech": "That's correct, but I -- that's correct. That's correct, but I do think the difference is that in the initial -- whether, in -- under a procedural due process analysis there is a difference. For the First Amendment the question is, is that speech occurring during that period of time, and how long a period of time can that be allowed to happen. The decisions that the city makes in a scheme like this are decisions about things like whether there were minors in the store, what was the age of the people, were they there, were they not there, were the booths covered or were they not covered so that you could be able to tell what was going on inside them, was there sexual activity that some of the patrons were engaging in or not. Those are very, very different from the kinds of decisions that were made in the Freedman context, and since those decisions are the kinds of things that municipalities make in generally in enforcing police power-type ordinances, there's no reason for them not to be given, in fact, when they make them."

If I'm operating a radio station and the city takes my license away because I've let the fence around my tower get into slight disrepair, and my defense is that the provision of the ordinance that says you can lose your license for having your fence in disrepair slightly is unconstitutional, I can't even raise that defense until I get to court, and if I don't get prompt judicial review or a stay of the status quo and be allowed to operate until my judicial decision, I will in all likelihood be out of business and I won't have any effective judicial review on that constitutional defense, and the administrative process can't touch that constitutional argument. This Court's decisions are clear that delay in a licensing process can lead to content-based censorship just as easy as lack of standards, even in a situation where licensing decisions are not expressly based on the content of the material. Lakewood I think also warns us that an ongoing business is a more likely target of content-based discrimination in the licensing process at the administrative level. The --"

We allow you to keep your license pending the decision. But if there's no basis for that, so that it is just a time, place, and manner-type restraint, why should you be able to maintain the status quo, which is, allowed to go on with the business, in face of very serious charges of violations that have nothing to do with the content of the books and tapes that are sold?"

Nonrenewal is required for one single, trivial violation of a provision of the ordinance that may well be unconstitutional. We can't test the constitutionality of that provision on the face of the ordinance until we get to court. There are really large numbers of people out there, highly motivated, with influence in municipal affairs, who are waiting for this Court to give them an opening for the covert censorship of sexually explicit speech through delay of licensure, or through any other method that allows room for indirect action. Not only my client, as an adult book store, but other people who are engaging in unpopular speech and mainstream media ask this Court not to create that opening for covert censorship by delay of the judicial review until that delay becomes fatal to many businesses who won't have meaningful judicial review because they'll just die on the vine while they're waiting for a judicial decision. A temporary injunction that they have to take the burden of getting in circuit court is not going to be an answer. First of all, it's the kind of cumbersome and time-consuming and expensive measure that, as Justice Harlan, concurring in Shuttlesworth, said, you shouldn't have to engage in to pursue your free speech rights, and second, it's a flawed process because you have to wait for the administrative record to prove you've got a chance of prevailing."
