    "speech": "Mr. Olson --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- is this a speech licensing scheme?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It is a speech licensing scheme because it requires a license to operate an adult book store."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it's different than Freedman, in the sense that Freedman was expressly designed to permit that licensing decisions that are not expressly content- based can still be used for covert content-based censorship."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Are you claiming that any of the reasons that were given -- this is a case of a license that was in existence, and it was -- it's a nonrenewal case, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the nonrenewal was based on violation, alleged violation of the terms of the license. Are you contesting that any of those terms, like no minors on the premises, open booths, that any of those terms violate the First Amendment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Not in this case.  We will do that in some future case, but we have not made that argument in this case and we don't think the Court should reach that"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Oh, all of those laws of general application that don't act as prior restraints targeted at speech can be enforced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How are the violations here targeted at speech?  I believe that the accusation was they were -- involve conduct, nothing to do with speech in the books in the store."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "They're targeted at speech in the sense that they're tied to the license, and they're tied to the permission to continue your ongoing speech."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, so you have a book store, and it says you can have a license to sell a book store, open your book store provided there isn't electricity running all over the floor and electrocuting people."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Those --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is that then subject to some special licensing scheme violates the First Amendment if it permits the status quo to be altered to the applicant's detriment during the administrative proceedings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How do you get that from Freedman, because Freedman, the status quo was no speech.  That is, the Court said you must have a graphic procedure, because you're not allowing someone to speak.  Here, a speaker has been permitted to speak, has a license, and the question is whether it will be renewed.  So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you're asking for, the continued speech is the status quo, as distinguished from Freedman, where no speech was the status quo."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's absolutely correct.  In Freedman and in Southeastern Promotions the Court said that a prior restraint before judicial review can be wasn't it, where the performance could not go on under the existence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It was a new speech case, that's correct, but I believe the Court found that the status quo was altered to the applicant's detriment because the show in the presentation of Hair in Southeastern Promotions had to be postponed and they lost their date for the presentation. We believe that the third principle governing this case is that a licensing scheme that acts as a prior restraint must confer upon an unsuccessful applicant the right to prompt judicial review, and the fourth principle is that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you really -- is that really your principle?  As I understand your case, it's not prompt judicial review as such, as was the case in Freedman, but"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But then if that's the case it's nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review. It's simply that you retain your license until judicial review is over, however long it takes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It's right that that's the rule we're urging the Court to find in Southeastern Promotions and FW/PBS and apply in this case, but it's wrong to say that it has nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review, I think, because the question on which the Court granted certiorari is does the licensing ordinance have to contain language to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review, and the only way to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review when you're enacting city licensing ordinance is to maintain the status quo, guarantee the status quo --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But that can be done by the court. if, as you tell us, the court having judicial review must maintain the status quo?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, it's not sufficient for five reasons.  First, the timing of that sort of temporary relief is in the discretion of the circuit court and can depend on lots of factors, including docket pressure --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Not if it's constitutionally required, as you tell us.  You tell us that the status quo has to be maintained.  If that's so, you have a -- you know, a lock on a stay order from the court as soon as the case gets there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, that really depends on what this Court says in this case.  If the Court says in this case, as we urge it to say, that the status quo through judicial review must be guaranteed, then I suppose we advisory opinion?  If it is indeed the case, as you say it is, that the court must issue a stay order, why can't we await that event?  If and when a court doesn't issue a stay order, then you've been harmed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I don't think that a stay order, the possibility of a stay order in the circuit court is an adequate substitute for Freedman safeguards, including maintenance of the status quo as written into the ordinance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the supreme court of Wisconsin held -- was it the supreme court, or the court of appeals?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Court of appeals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The court of appeals held that what you're asking for was not required here, didn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "The court of appeals believed that the status quo would be maintained through the Freedman and Southeastern Promotions that we're making here today."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, couldn't you argue that the administrative determination by the city was arbitrary or capricious?  Isn't that a ground for judicial review of an administrative order?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "We could.  That would be an argument going to the merits of the claim and, of course, it would be relevant to the issuance of a stay, because we have to show probability of success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Your position basically is, even though your claim substantively has no merit, you're still entitled to an automatic stay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I don't even get to whether we're entitled to an automatic stay in my thinking, because I don't think that the possibility of a stay being imposed"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, all right, you say this, we have a claim on the merits, and you say, judge, decide it. Decide it before we have to close down.  Now, if they do, it's fine, right?  You have no complaint as long as the judge decides your claim on the merits before you have to shut the door."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "In an as-applied challenge that would be correct, but this is a facial challenge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No,  but I'm not saying about this case.  Suppose it was always true that the judges would decide on the merits before anyone had to shut the door."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "If that were always true, then --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No problem, all right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "-- the court wouldn't have to worry about a specific guarantee --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Fine, then why aren't you better off, it is to win."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Not -- not really, in terms of timing especially.  We can't show a reasonable probability of success on the merits in an administrative review until that administrative record gets to the court, and there's no time limit on that under the unamended ordinance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "This case has an air of unreality to it, because in fact your client did get a stay until the end of the judicial road without making a showing of probability of success on the merits and, in fact, the entire case has been now adjudicated on the merits, is that not so?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's correct, and we have no as- applied challenge here.  This is strictly a facial challenge case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But isn't it also have an air of a disability from licensure that flows from having violated the ordinance by operating without a license, which I told them they were entitled to do under Shuttlesworth, because --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But there's a disability for licensure for a business he has no intention of engaging in, as I understand it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, there's no showing that they intend to engage in this business, or that they have not applied for a new license and they don't have an application pending now, but they haven't foresworn any intention to apply for a license at some other location in the future."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I have the impression -- I may be unfair to you -- that you may be representing interests other than the named party to the case here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes.  The City News and Novelty is footing the bill for this case because they believe they're right, they believe in it's important principle, and they don't want the 5-year disability from licensure that will fall on the corporation and its officers.  If they're determined to have been operating without a license in violation of a valid ordinance up until February 14, 2000, which is when they stopped operating as an adult book store, they'd be disabled from licensure in Waukesha for 5 years after that, until Valentine's Day 2005."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That disability has nothing -- I mean, that disability has something to do with a defect in the system that might have produced a merits decision that was contrary to the facts, or contrary to the law, but I don't see how that disability has anything to do with the it's not an interest that depends at all upon the issue that you're bringing before us here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, they do in the following sense.  If there is no valid judicial review path in this licensing ordinance, then there's no valid renewal mechanism, and the whole licensing requirement becomes facially invalid.  Then they're entitled to operate without a license."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you're not saying that the whole judicial review mechanism is invalid in the sense that it has produced an unjust or incorrect substantive decision. You're saying that there's one feature of it, namely whether your client was allowed to operate in the meantime that rendered it unfair, but I don't see how that has anything to do with your -- the propriety of preventing your client from operating in the future, once a"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There is a -- there was a -- I forgot what the title of the case was, but a decision of this Court explaining that if you were entitled to something as a matter of constitutional right, due process, like notice, it doesn't matter that the notice provision isn't in the law itself, as long as the court insists on it. Then you have no constitutional right that has been violated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's right.  There are some of the cases going to the requirement of, for example, explicit and specific and objective licensing standards that recognize that these could be -- these could come from usage or authoritative construction, as well as on the face of the legislation, but here there is no usage or authoritative construction that builds a status quo --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, do you have -- all we know is experience, and I don't know why we shouldn't assume that other cases would proceed in this same pattern and not in some other pattern."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "The Court has held in more than one case that license applicants are entitled more to the hope of the grace -- to more than the hope of the grace of the Government.  They're entitled to a guarantee.  In other words, maybe they will.  Maybe they will let the next guy stay open, too, or maybe they'll say that we let Olson's clients stay open because that was test case, raising constitutional issues about our ordinance and we weren't sure how it was going to come out, now we know, so you've got to close with our nonrenewal decision.  We're entitled --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Olson, does the fact that you're making a facial constitutional challenge here in your view it from being mooted out by the subsequent amendments to the ordinance that have taken place four times this year."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Maybe, is it standing?  I mean, as I understand it you're saying -- you're complaining about a procedural flaw, call it X."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And as far as your client is concerned, X never happened to him."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "As far as your client was concerned, it's now been determined that he violated the statute on the merits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And your client says, I'm out of business anyway, I've made an agreement not to try to get back into it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Sure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Generally the purpose of the facial challenge is to protect third parties who may not be before the court, but here, is it not a fact that the third parties are largely, maybe not entirely protected by the amendment to the ordinance, from the very danger that you're seeking -- the very principle you're seeking to vindicate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "The third parties are protected from a couple of the original problems.  They're protected from indefinite time -- indefinite times in the administrative procedure.  But they're not protected from lack of prompt judicial review and lack of preservation of the status quo during judicial review.  The third parties out there who will apply for renewal in the future under this ordinance will still face those facial problems with the scheme as them it would not be. But here your client is in exactly the same position as the other people, and should that make a difference?  One reason why it might make a difference is, if it turns out that this supposedly facially invalid ordinance in practice is applied in a perfectly valid way to you, should we therefore assume that it will be different when the ordinance is applied to third parties?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So I'm wondering whether you're really in a situation in which our cases recognize your right to raise a third-party right where you're in the same boat with them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "I think your cases prevent you from assuming that we are in the same boat with them.  I think they prevent you from assuming that they won't be required will get that, and they are entitled --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "There's also, usually a champion comes forward and says, other people are going to be chilled, but in this case not only aren't others chilled from getting into this business, but you're being edged out not because of any ordinance, but because a bigger player has taken over and there's not -- and has squeezed you out of the market."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Maybe not totally out of the market. They might want to apply for a license at some other location."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But they are perfectly adequate champion of themselves.  It's not like the person who is going to be afraid to demonstrate for fear of being arrested.  It's -- I don't see any chill of people like, what is it, the B -- whatever the organization that has floor, and you have to close until you get a judicial decision on the merits that that's an unconstitutional criterion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Maybe we have been misconstruing your argument.  Is your argument not that there is a third- party right that you were raising, but an argument that even as to you in this case, in which you were allowed to operate as the proceedings progressed, even as to you in this case, the statute was simply flatly unconstitutional and therefore the entire proceeding was unconstitutional, even though you weren't shut down pending the determination."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "We do contend that, and we do contend that at least on remand the nonrenewal order will have to be vacated because it was issued pursuant to an unconstitutional licensing scheme. of its adult license for committing nine separate violations of our municipal code, including permitting minors to loiter and allowing sexual activity to both occur on the premises.  The City of Waukesha maintains that a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination, as required in Freedman in the context of a censorship scheme, is neither applicable or required for a licensing ordinance that focuses on the secondary effects of such establishments and targets prior misconduct not protected by the Constitution. The specific issue before this Court, which is before the Court today, is that -- whether such an ordinance, which has neither the effect or purpose of limiting or restricting the content of any commutative materials must provide either a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination, versus the availability or access still going to be a content restriction on speech if this establishment is shut down, and that is true simply because the nature of the establishment is rather content- specific, so you're going to have a content -- you're going to have an effect which is correlated to content, so that's why I wonder if it's fair for you to say that the ordinance does not have the effect, in addition to not having the purpose of a content restriction, because I think they're saying it does have the effect of a content restriction, and that's why you ought to have some safeguards."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "In answering your question, Justice Souter, this Court said in the seminal cases, in the first and the plurality of American Mini Theatres, and in Renton, that these types of establishments, adult establishments do have a effect on the surrounding"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It is content-neutral for certain purposes, but he is saying that there ought to be some procedural safeguard that recognizes the fact that even these so-called content-neutral limitations based on secondary effects do have an effect on speech, and that effect is at least very closely correlated with content, and he's saying that for that reason, even though you can regulate it -- that's not being contested, is it, as a broad proposition -- even though you can regulate it, there ought to be some limits on your regulation because of the damage that you can and do on a content-basis, in effect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "And I think that is clear.  As the Court -- a plurality stated in FW/PBS, technically this is a -- requires prior restraint analysis, and we do initially, we provide the objective standards for review, you off, but I think what you're saying -- and this may be fine, but I want to make sure I understand it.  You're saying, yes, so long as we meet certain conditions, not all the conditions he wants, we can have an effect on content."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "I think what we're going to find here is certainly --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But isn't that your position?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "There will be what we consider an incidental burden on content.  There clearly will be, but this Court on numerous occasions involving time, place, and manner restrictions where you have in place some restrictions, as long as they're incidental, and incidental as this Court has defined on many occasions, is that the regulation is essential to the furtherance of the interest, and clearly here, our interest, our interest in All he's saying is, if you're going to regulate on that perfectly legitimate basis, you've got to do it promptly. That's the argument.  Why can't you do it promptly --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "And I --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- and therefore why is it a burden? I mean, that seems to me what the issue is in this case. Why is it a burden that you should not carry?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "We would agree with that.  We believe that the argument of administrative determine -- of prompt judicial administrative determination is not the issue before the Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But do you agree that it's required?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well then, what's the difference between an administrative delay, which you concede the Constitution prohibits, and a judicial delay? Court to have strict rules about administrative expedition but not judicial, other than what Justice -- the line of questions Justice Scalia was indicating, that there is authority to issue a stay?  Other than that, what would be the reason?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "The reason is, is the requirement for a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination in Freedman is because the licensing scheme in Maryland was passing a determination on the content of what is obscenity.  This Court has stated, to obviate the risks associated with that the judiciary has the expertise to make determinations concerning the constitutionality or whether a matter is protected or unprotected.  That is clear, that an administrative review body is not the final arbiter. If they want to declare something obscene or decided whether the ensuing judicial review, whether it has to provide for a prompt decision or just prompt access to the courts, to courts having a power to maintain the status quo if the appropriate showing is made."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "We believe that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is there a difference between access and final decision and what do you think our cases hold in that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "For matters involving censorship or content-based situations, it's clear from Freedman and its progeny, Southeastern, that a prompt judicial, guarantee of a prompt judicial determination is necessary to minimize the risk, and the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You mean final determination?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "As opposed to access? is necessary.  Is it necessary here that there be a provision on the face of the statute for prompt final judicial decision, or just prompt access to the court for judicial review?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "Prompt access, Justice O'Connor, because we believe that the purpose, the reason for a prompt judicial determination to eliminate that discouraging effect on the individual film exhibitor to go into court and the expertise, which only the judiciary has, that is not applicable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it seems to me it would go the other way around.  If the administrative agency has expertise, and it's required to expedite, in your case, but the judiciary doesn't, then you're allowing the entity without expertise to delay.  That seems to me, you have it backwards."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I go back to my earlier question.  If the premise is that the Constitution requires expedition at the administrative level, why doesn't it have the same requirement at the judicial level?  Expertise can't be the answer, because that works against you, it seems to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "The reason it would not be required, you have to look at the underlying rationale of Freedman and why Freedman required a prompt judicial determination, because of specifically what the Court said -- filed like, the 37 photographs.  You are not in the position, censor -- you are -- you're in the business of censoring, and you are not sensitive to the protected versus unprotected speech."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, isn't there something, too, to the idea that when you get into court, you're dealing with a neutral tribunal, whereas perhaps the administrative directed at adult book stores but a statute directed at, let's say, radio stations?  It's not addressed at all business, just radio stations. It picks them out, and it addresses the external effects of radio stations.  If they're found to be in violation of the sanitary code because they're infested with rats, or because the plumbing is unsafe, or because the electricity is unsafe, their license can be revoked. It seems to me a very parallel situation.  Now, would you say that you could have a hearing under that statute directed only at radio stations, and shut down the radio station before the opportunity for complete judicial review has been accorded?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "If you're obviously not trying to --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I am worried --"

    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "-- control the content, but if it's interest in controlling, and as part of its public --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "A court would want to inquire into why only radio stations were prohibited from having rats in them, as opposed to every other kind of business, I suppose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "I would agree with that, but I think, again I bring the Court back to the seminal cases of American Mini Theatres and Renton.  The Court recognized that these secondary effects associated with such establishments are important and substantial, and they allow the municipality some flexibility with dealing with these very serious problems, so yes, in a sense --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Those cases just dealt with the location of the business.  They didn't go into procedures at all, Renton and Mini Theatres."

    "speech": "Renton and Mini Theatres was a"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But again, that didn't have anything to do with the timing of the decision, as I remember it, did it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MEITZ",
    "speech": "Well, the Court there analyzed that as intermediate scrutiny, time, place, and manner restriction."
  },

I suppose the theory would be that when he goes for renewal again he might be affected, or that he -- the crucial -- this is not contents-based, it's true, but although in the FW/PBS case, which was identical to this in terms of whether it was content-based, the Court said the party could also raise these procedural interests, First Amendment interests, could make a challenge to the constitutionality of that scheme. I do think that on the merits the important -- the crucial point here is that the decisions the city makes are not content-based.  Unlike in a situation like Freedman, where the Court said, this Court said that a reviewing court has to be able -- has to -- is necessary, because what the State was doing was looking at the particular movie and making a judgment based on that content about whether that movie should be allowed."

In the Freedman context, what the Court was saying, we don't want this censor's decision to go into effect for any significant period of time without a judge looking at it.  It's not really a final determination of law until you go into court, until a judge has a chance to look at it and decide whether the material --"

I was only making the point that there was a unique feature present in a Freedman-type case, which is, you don't want any effect to be given, or any substantial effect to be given to the administrative decision because it's a content-based decision on the content of that speech.   You don't want any effect to be given to that, basically, until it gets into court. Here, the point of FW/PBS was, that can have some effect as long as the proper procedures are required, and --"

That's correct, but I do think the difference is that in the initial -- whether, in -- under a procedural due process analysis there is a difference.  For the First Amendment the question is, is that speech occurring during that period of time, and how long a period of time can that be allowed to happen. The decisions that the city makes in a scheme like this are decisions about things like whether there were minors in the store, what was the age of the people, were they there, were they not there, were the booths covered or were they not covered so that you could be able to tell what was going on inside them, was there sexual"

If I'm operating a radio station and the city takes my license away because I've let the fence around my tower get into slight disrepair, and my defense is that the provision of the ordinance that says you can lose your license for having your fence in disrepair slightly is unconstitutional, I can't even raise that defense until I get to court, and if I don't get prompt judicial review or a stay of the status quo and be allowed to operate until my judicial decision, I will in all likelihood be out of business and I won't have any effective judicial review on that constitutional defense, and the administrative process can't touch that constitutional argument. This Court's decisions are clear that delay in a proper answer isn't, because there is this danger, the court will look at it case-by-case and if, indeed, this is a situation where the administrator is abusing authority to disguise what is really content-based regulation, the court can say in that situation, we put a freeze on it. We allow you to keep your license pending the decision. But if there's no basis for that, so that it is just a time, place, and manner-type restraint, why should you be able to maintain the status quo, which is, allowed to go on with the business, in face of very serious charges of violations that have nothing to do with the content of the books and tapes that are sold?"

Nonrenewal is required for one single, trivial violation of a provision of the ordinance that may well be unconstitutional.  We other people who are engaging in unpopular speech and mainstream media ask this Court not to create that opening for covert censorship by delay of the judicial review until that delay becomes fatal to many businesses who won't have meaningful judicial review because they'll just die on the vine while they're waiting for a judicial decision. A temporary injunction that they have to take the burden of getting in circuit court is not going to be an answer.  First of all, it's the kind of cumbersome and time-consuming and expensive measure that, as Justice Harlan, concurring in Shuttlesworth, said, you shouldn't have to engage in to pursue your free speech rights, and second, it's a flawed process because you have to wait for the administrative record to prove you've got a chance of"
