Those Indiana voters who lack the identification now required by the new photo ID law must overcome substantial practical and financial burdens before they can continue to exercise their constitutional right. Now, the State says that those burdens are justified by the need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation fraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many times that such a justification should not just be accepted at face value, but instead it should be scrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is both real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden being imposed on constitutional rights."

But in this case, Your Honor, the Democratic Party was found to have standing correctly, I believe, on at least two grounds, associational standing as well as what you might call haven standing, the organizational interest being impaired by virtue of this law."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "speech": "Well Your Honor, the thing that confines the rationale is it has to be something that relates as well to the purpose of the organization, of the association, the reason why these people are bound together as a group, and that is of course to get people to vote and vote to support -- support the goals of the organization, support the candidates, the nominees of the organization."

So that that -- there is specific standing evidence in there of specific people who, much more than just your average voter, are active in party affairs. They may not have a -- be card-carrying members of the Democratic Party, but they are as much a part of the Democratic Party as anybody possibly could be, who were identified in response to interrogatories, about 9 or 10 of them, and were found to be satisfactory for purposes of standing by the district court on the equal protection claim. Now, in addition I would note as I suggested to Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the associational standing because the Democratic Party clearly is injured in its own right as an organization.

There was also a considerable amount of testimony about other people who said they wanted to vote, who spoke to many of the other plaintiffs, Mr. Crawford, the NAACP chapter. There's a lot of other plaintiffs who also submitted evidence of people saying: I don't have an ID, I'm not going to be able to get one, I'm not going to be able to vote."

But what the State did in 2002 was it ratcheted up the difficulty of getting one by requiring for the first time that you have an original certified birth certificate that you paid for and that -- and then you have to go through the hoops of what kind of identification you need for that."

So if he goes in and votes in one place and says, well, I'm going to -- I expect he's going to go in the other place, sooner or later, if you had any significant amount of this kind of fraud occurring, people would be coming in and saying I can't vote.

Someone walks in, saying: I'm Joe Smith. He doesn't say: I'm Joe Smith dead. He says, I'm Joe Smith, and he signs something. And the poll worker looks at it and the signature looks very weird. Well, what's the poll worker supposed to do? He's not going to go disrupt the election. And is there going to be a policeman there to follow this person home? Of course not. So that's their claim.

That is something that inconveniences some people. And we're talking about 35 times more -- in terms of a percentage, we're talking about 66.8 percent or so of the population that reports being registered to vote, far short of the percentage based on the calculations of the district court or anything in the ballpark of that that don't have photo identification.

So, if you're going to talk about what is the impact of this, they are in this bind after the election -- well -- they've always -- already lost that one. Now, there is something in the briefs that happened after this case was instituted, but we know from Marion County that there were 34 people who were not able to have a vote counted. And of those 34, only two ended up qualifying after the fact. So, we know that in that one particular county, most of the people who were unable to satisfy the requirement initially ended up not satisfying it. Is that -- I mean that's not hypothetical.

      "speech": "If you're worried about fraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it through with you, is the registration system. As I read the Indiana voter registration application, all a person has to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility bill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't have a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his Social Security; and if he doesn't have that either he doesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a number -- and you mail it in. And you're registered. So all a person who have to do if he wants to be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and he has a photo ID; he can go to the polls. So my question to you is this: given that system of registration, focusing on the issue before us, why don't you just say and we'll give to you -- you put on -- if you don't have a photo ID, we'll give you one. Now there it would not stand as an obstacle; that apparently is what Georgia has done. And it doesn't require people to go out and spend $10 or $5 or something digging up their birth certificate, which if you tried to do, is quite a job for many people. And therefore, you'd have all the things you want. All you would do is with the 43,000 people who don't have the IDs, you'd say we'll get you one. No big deal. You have a photo machine there when they come in to register; they have to go down; you take a picture of them and you hand it to them. And I would think that that less restrictive way would satisfy your anti-fraud interests far better than the way you've chosen, but I leave my judgment out of it. I just would like you to talk through why that isn't a less restrictive way, which is far better in achieving your anti-fraud interests, or at least as good."

The other thing we run into is the REAL ID Act. If Indiana wants to have an identification card that can be acceptable in Federal facilities, it's going to have to have minimal criteria for issuing those photo identifications. And so I think with respect to that, it would not be permissible to get around a birth certificate, which is kind of a foundational document.

The vast majority of voters are already in compliance with this law, and the decision of the General Assembly, that it is a reasonable step to take for a measure of election security to bring the State's voting system into the 21st century and to require the same photo identification that you have to show typically to get on an airplane, to get into many Federal courthouses, is a reasonable step in the right direction to preserve voter confidence."

Accordingly Petitioners cannot take issue that the constitutionality of some mechanism for ascertaining voter ID. And I take it from today's argument that they would concede the constitutionality of a signature match requirement. Likewise, nobody can really dispute the proposition that a government-issued photo ID is an awfully good way of verifying someone's identity. So the dispute really boils down to, in a system where the States can legitimately ask for some kind of basis to ascertain ID, can they insist on a particularly good one, the photo ID? And we would suggest that there's nothing in the First or Fourteenth Amendments that precludes that from happening. Now, with respect to the nature of this challenge, I think one thing that's very evident from the questions is this was a challenge that was brought to the statute on its face and was brought before there was any enforcement of the statute or any significant enforcement of the statute. Now, I would respectfully suggest that there's a better way to test the constitutionality of these statutes."

They do have a burden that, it seems to me, the State could easily eliminate if they want those people to vote, and that is to say okay, do the affidavit, the whole thing in your local precinct; we'll make it easy for you and not send you away, send you off to the county courthouse to get it validated.

In particular, I think if you look at the Plaintiffs, the individual members, if they are members of the Indiana party that have been identified, they've certainly identified people who do not have the ID currently. I'm not sure that they were specific as to whether they were indigent or not. I'm not sure the individuals, the nine individuals, were really parsed out that way. And I would think the far better way to go about dealing with that issue is to take as a starting point -- I mean you pointed out that there were 32 provisional ballots cast in the Marion County election. Now, I gather from the State that's something like 0.02 percent of the ballots cast.

Now, at the end of the day, you may not be persuaded that that's the way to do it. I think that's a reasonable argument, but an as-applied challenge could focus like a laser beam on those particular voters and those challenges. You could have particular indigent voters in front of you.

      "speech": "I think it's a close question, Mr. Chief Justice. I would say that I think there is standing. I think the standing that exists here is the standing to represent the nine or so individuals that are addressed specifically on pages 49a and 51a of the district court opinion. Those are individuals who do not have photo IDs. I think that as to the membership issue, boy, if the Indiana Democratic Party has any members, its probably these individuals, because they are poll workers and active in the parties. And what I would say about those individuals, though, is that it is telling that the only individuals they have been able to identify who don't have photo IDs also happen to be elderly individuals who can, by right, vote by absentee ballot. Now, that's not to say -- and I would -- I would concede there is a legally protected interest in voting in person sufficient to cross the Article III threshold. But I think, when you are looking for the real world impact, it is telling that the people they have been able to identify do have a ready mechanism available to them."

You know, I don't think that's relevant in this -- I would hate to think that a party line vote would necessarily give the other party standing as a general rule. I don't think that you would adopt that, and this goes out of the record, of course, to a recent study. But the one study that's been done actually shows that the Democratic Party did well in the 2006 elections, and turnout went up a little bit."

      "speech": "Thank you, Your Honor. Let me start by addressing the question of what reasonable alternatives there are to the strict law that we are dealing with here. This is the most strict law in the country. And what you have when you look at the range of laws that are out there in other States is a very different set of responses that occur when a voter shows up without an ID in hand. In Michigan and several other States, for example, the response is to say: All right, we are going to make you fill out an affidavit attesting to who you are, and that you are a registered voter; that you live in this precinct; and we'll let you go ahead and vote a regular ballot. That in those States they -- they consider that a sufficient safeguard while looking at the IDs of all the people who have the IDs. In Florida they have a different approach, which is to let you vote a provisional ballot, and then what they do is they judge your signature match later on in exactly the same process that's used for absentee ballots. We have a lot of information in this record about why it's okay to have absentee ballots allowed without an ID in Indiana, and they say, well, we have these specialized committees that know how to do signature matches; and they are trained; and so we get thousands of these absentee ballots in. But we can very carefully scrutinize them. You could do very easily do exactly the same thing with respect to the provisional ballots cast by people who show up without their ID without - -"

      "speech": "Yes, there are; and it's this Court's job under the Burdick line of cases to weigh the benefits and the burdens and come out with the appropriate decision about whether the legislature went too hard -- far. Let me talk a little bit about this facial versus as-applied approach. To paraphrase King Lear: That way lies madness, Your Honor. This Court has never looked at these issues on an as-applied basis. The Burdick test, in its very nature, is about facial weighing of systemic benefits and burdens from the particular rule. And there is a reason for that, because the concern is systemic; that the burdens that are being imposed, a whole range of them depending on the kind of people involved and their particular circumstances, will have an effect on the outcome of the election overall. Imagine, if you will, what it would be like to try to have all these class actions being brought, some by the people who don't have IDs, some by the people who have IDs but don't have enough money. You would have to figure out exactly how much money people are allowed to have in order to be in this exempt class. The courts would then be creating exempt classes, trying to decide whether the legislature would have wanted an exemption drawn or not. The whole thing would be a complete and utter morass. And, ultimately, even if you did carve out an exception for indigent people or for some other group of people, you ultimately would leave untouched the real problem, which is the concern that even for people who are relatively - - suffer relatively minor inconvenience, maybe one percent of them are not going to show up and vote. And that's exactly what the legislature may have been trying to accomplish here. So that is not the way the jurisprudence in this area ever looks at it. Nobody applied the poll -- nobody challenged the poll tax as-applied."

That's our -- our analysis, and I think it's certainly completely consistent with every decision right up through Klingman a couple of years ago. That's the test that this Court applies."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "speech": "Well, you have to make some judgment about the incremental, additional benefit above what's already been in place for decades, and it worked extremely effectively, Your Honor. And, obviously, you do the balancing. I'm just the advocate here. But it seems to me you have to say is there any real benefit here compared to these burdens?"

      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Well, if you want to talk about increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our judgment does more harm than good; whether -- whether the remedy for -- for the inconvenience to a small number of people is to wash away the whole statute, which in most of its applications is perfectly okay? Why don't we do that weighing of benefits and burdens of increments versus needs?"

      "speaker": "SMITH",

But if you come in and you come to the conclusion that there is essentially no real, significant benefit from making all of these other people who have IDs show them, then the balance comes out that you throw the law out. That's the way the analysis works."
