Legislation regarding how an entity is to treat an employee is understood to refer to the entity's own employees. And that is particularly true here where the phrase \"terms and conditions\" of employment is used in the statute. If Section 1514A forbade only contractors to retaliate against employees under the terms and conditions of their employment, I don't think there'd be any question that the courts would understand it was referring to the contractor's own employees. The statute has the same ­­ that language has the same meaning, even though it's combined in this instance with prohibitions against retaliation by other types of actors. The First Circuit's decision interpreting 1514A to permit a contractor to retaliate against its own employees is inconsistent with its general usage and it leads to four implausible consequences. First, it renders the statutory language regarding contractors virtually meaningless. Secondly, it renders that language with regard to contractors in the mutual fund industry literally meaningless. Third, it has the implausible consequence of permitting the very type of retaliation that we know Congress was concerned about. Retaliation um­ by an accountant such as Arthur Andersen. And finally, it renders incoherent the provisions in 1514A and the related remedial provision regarding scienter,uh the burden of proof and an affirmative defense."

I think Congress correctly concluded that if it tried to write out a description of what else it was covering, someone would think of a way to get around it. And I think it certainly wouldn't have contemplated that Federal courts were to try to untangle these relationships to the point where they could figure out whether, for example, if Andrew Fastow was skimming off money from Chewco, whether that would be sufficiently related to Enron. It's just, it's enormously complicated and I think Congress didn't mean to open the door to that. And that's brought home by the fact that the statute is written more broadly than AIR­21. It's essentially modeled on AIR­21, which is a statute adopted a couple years earlier about whistleblowing in the airline industry, particularly with regard to safety work. In that statute, \"contractor\" is specifically defined to mean an airline contractor dealing with safety. They did not put that kind of limitation here, and I think it, in part, because it simply would have been very difficult to do. And I don't think they meant to give the courts a commission to try to sort that sort of thing out. The core problem with the interpretation of the court of appeals is that it really renders almost meaningless the decision of Congress to prohibit retaliation by contractors and subcontractors. Contractors and subcontractors would rarely be in a position to engage in retaliation, but particularly to engage in the very specific kind of retaliation specified in the statute, retaliation in the terms and conditions of employment."

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Alito asked why didn't Congress say all employers or no employers? There are approximate 40 whistleblower statutes on the books as of today, Your Honors. And more than 30 of them, in fact, 36 of them, are phrased exactly that way. They say \"No employer may retaliate\" or \"Any employer is prohibited from retaliating.\" This statute is not phrased that way. This statute, which Congress could have written that way, and Dodd­Frank 922 is written that way, this statute is written quite differently. This statute says, \"No public company may retaliate,\" and then it has a subordinate clause and the subordinate clause is what's at issue here, that references officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and agents. Justice Alito also asked my friend, Mr. Schnapper, do you contend that the same construction should be given to officers and to contractors, and he acknowledged they have to say no, because the ARB has also said no. In other words, an employee, the phrase that we are construing at the bottom of all of this, these turtles, is different they say for officers and employees and agents, presumably, than for contractors and subcontractors. But that doesn't fit with the statute. It doesn't fit with the tools of statutory construction, and it doesn't fit with what Congress was trying to do here. This was the ­­ the failure of Enron. This was a bankruptcy situation. Congress was acutely aware that corporate bankruptcies, failures, left victims high and dry. One of the other provisions in this title, Section 803, specifically deals with the dischargeability of shareholder fraud debts in bankruptcy. And what these sub ­­ the subordinate clause that added these corporate representatives does is make sure that if the employer, the public company, goes out of business, the way Enron had just done, somebody is on the hook for the money damages that Congress authorized for these employees like Sharon Watkins. It's a very simple regime to make sure that the victim, the whistleblower, is not left high and dry if the company that is, by hypothesis, riddled with fraud goes out of business."

And if he gets fired, he's completely protected and has reinstatement and back pay. Congress dealt with that. There ­­ there is a gap of eight years. We definitely acknowledge that. But Congress moves incrementally in this area. The ­­ the Sarbanes­Oxley Act was the first major widespread corporate governance reform at the Federal level, and Congress didn't purport to do everything at once. It went a long way. It subjected every public company to these new things. But for my friends to suggest that they covered not just the 5,000 public companies, but all 6 million private companies without ever mentioning the fact, without ever discussing it, without debating it, without acknowledging that that would be the consequence is a dramatic ­­ a dramatic expansion of this statute that was already pretty dramatic to begin with, that barely passed, as the Court may remember."

What we know is the SEC has not exercised its power under 3(a) or under 307 or under 501, also dealing with contractors of sorts, to provide for whistleblower protections. If it chooses to do so in the future, then we would have a different lawsuit. What we have now, however, is the unadorned statute passed by Congress, which deals with public companies. We have the First Circuit in an exhaustive opinion construing it, again using all the ordinary tools of statutory construction, which this Court has directed the lower courts to do, to determine plausibly, as everyone agrees, plausibly that it only covers public companies. We have a reading, then, that gives meaning to every single meaning to every single word in the statute, that is comprehensible, that fits the purpose of the statute. Remember the overall purpose of the statute is disclosure by public companies. It is not protection of investors, as some at times have said. It is disclosures by public companies. Private companies make no disclosures. They are not governed by the securities laws. So excluding private company employees makes perfect sense in that respect. Mutual funds, Mr. Schnapper at page 13 of his reply brief says: Well, the advisors make all the disclosures for the mutual funds. We had that argument, Your Honor, two years ago. Justice Thomas wrote the opinion for the Court in the Janus case, which rejected that very argument and said the mutual fund and the advisor are separate companies; the mutual fund makes the disclosures. Congress has set up the mutual fund industry that way. The ICI's brief in this case explains very cogently, I believe, all of the separate protections, including the independent board of directors and the chief compliance officer mandated by the SEC's '40 Act regulations that protect the investors in mutual funds. So we have a coherent, on the First Circuit side, a coherent reading of the statute that my friends admit is plausible, that gives meaning to every word in the statute, that fits exactly the title that Congress used. And the title is legislative language passed by Congress signed by the President. It fits every word of the legislative history. It makes perfect sense and it doesn't have any untoward results.

And remember, I am going to agree with my friend Mr. Schnapper on something. Congress recognized that Enron was structured in a way to try to get the liability out of headquarters. They had all these subsidiaries, they had Chewco and Ponderosa and all this. And Congress recognized that corporations might try to avoid their liability, so that by picking up officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and agents, they were trying to make sure that if the company tried to lay off the responsibility on somebody else, they would still get captured because their employees were doing it. They could have done that just under agency. Many employment laws, of course, speak only of officers, employees, and agents. But many contracts disclaim agency, disclaim ­­"

      "speech": "I agree with that, but ­­ but the question came up about what their views were. With regard to the suggestion earlier that the ARB has taken the position that every contract ­­ every firm that has a contract with a public company is a contractor. Actually, in the Fleszar case, which is mentioned in both the Respondent's brief and our yellow brief, the ­­ the ARB is for the opposite position and ­­ and took a position, I think, consistent with the view we've advanced, which is not every contract renders you a contractor. With regard to Arthur Andersen, the discussion in the Senate Report about why there's a need to deal with retaliation is repeatedly about Arthur Andersen. Many of the people who actually understood what was going on at ­­ at Enron were Arthur Andersen employees, not most of the run­of­the­mill employees at Enron, and they were the ones who remained silent in the face of this very, very serious problem. With regard to the origins of this phrase contractor, my brother, Mr. Perry, was right, it comes from AIR­21. The preliminary AIR­21 regulations regarding what it means were issued prior to the adoption of SOX and they said it included employers ­­ employees of employers, which has remained the view of the agency throughout. My colleague ­­ with regard to AIR­21, the history here is, I think, important. This statute referred to air carriers and contractors and subcontractors, and the court below assumed that that meant that employees of subcontractors and contractors were covered. The First Circuit's theory was that Congress meant to narrow the meaning of contractor employees because it added retaliation by officers and employees. And it seems to me that that is precisely the wrong conclusion. When Congress added to the entities that could not retaliate, when it rewrote AIR­21 to add some other people that couldn't retaliate, it didn't mean to tacitly then eliminate the employees of contractors who were governed under AIR­21. Finally, with regard to the question the Court has raised about whether it should explore the possibility of a limitation based on whether a contractor was acting as a contractor, we think it would probably not be prudent to take that on at this time for a couple of reasons. First of all, a fair amount of work that was done by Arthur Andersen was not ­­ that was relevant wasn't done for Enron. It was done for the off­the­books enterprises. They did $5.7 million of accounting work for Jedi, where the debts ­­ one of the places where the debts were being hidden. So you ­­ you'd get into that problem. Secondly, this provision is adopted against the background of a series of executive orders, most important which is Executive Order 11246, about racial discrimination by Federal contractors. That executive order has always been understood to cover all the employees of the contractor, not just the employees who are working on the government project. And I think that's an important part of the background. Congress has not tried to ­­ the Executive Branch hasn't limited it to that. And in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of about 1986, Congress rewrote Title 6 and Title 9 to have institution­wide application rather than to do little parts of it. This issue about what a contractor might be doing as a contractor hasn't been vetted in lower courts and we think it would be not prudent to try to ­­ to take that on here. Thank you very much."
