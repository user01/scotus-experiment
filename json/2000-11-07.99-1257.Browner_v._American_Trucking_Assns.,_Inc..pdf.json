      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two principal issues in this first case and, with the Court's leave, I'll address each in turn. First, the Clean Air Act does not violate the nondelegation doctrine. The Act prescribes the following: EPA must set national ambient air quality standards for a limited set of ubiquitous pollutants. The standards must be requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. They must be based on criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge about the identifiable effects of the pollutant in the ambient air, and the administrator must consult an independent body of scientific experts and explain any significant departure from its recommendations. For 30 years, successive administrators have applied the Act's terms consistently. Requisite means sufficient, but not more than necessary to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. Public health addresses not all biological effects, and not even all medical effects, but only those adverse health effects that threaten populations. And identifiable effects means those that are shown to exist not hypothesized. The Court of Appeals --"

Now, they have to be also medically significant to a sufficient population to constitute a public health effect. The Court of Appeals held that the Constitution requires more, specifically the articulation of what it called a determinate criterion to govern the setting of the precise standard for each pollutant. That is contrary to this Court's precedents which require that the Court articulate only an intelligible principle or, as the Court has otherwise put it, that the Court delineate the general policy, the public agency that is to accomplish it, and the boundaries of the delegated authority."

      "speech": "Well, perhaps I -- if I may, perhaps I can, to answer your question by reference to either or both of the two pollutants that are at issue here. With respect to particulate matter, for example, there was a preexisting standard that was set in 1987. The Agency pursuant to the Act's requirements that the standards be reviewed every five years in light of the latest scientific knowledge went back and collected all of the medical and scientific study and prepared them in a criteria document, which is a multivolume set that is reviewed by CASAC, the independent advisory committee, which agreed that it was what it called the best ever compilation of the health effects of small particulate matter on public health. The EPA then created a -- what is called a staff paper. The staff paper distills the science and organizes the data in a series of recommendations. That, too, was reviewed by CASAC, which agreed that the ranges of concentrations -- and this I think is what you're getting to -- provided the appropriate parameters for the administrator's decision. Now, with respect to particulate matter, the staff recommended, and CASAC agreed, that it was important to separately measure particulate, fine particulate matter; that is, matter that is equal to or less than 25 micrograms per cubic meter. And if the staff with CASAC's approval set both the upper bound and the lower bound for the administrator's decision based on what the science revealed."

I thought the statute required that committee to advise the EPA of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of the national standards. I mean, the statute does require the scientific committee to look at all those things and to report it to the EPA. Now, why would Congress want that advice on economic and energy effects if Congress didn't want the EPA to consider those in setting the standards?"

For example, in all -- the Act essentially creates a two-part process. The first part is the setting of these national standards that set a floor for ambient air across the whole country and do not apply of their own force to any source of polluting, whether it's me driving my car or the utility plant that generates my power. The second part of the Act is implementation; that is, how do you go about achieving these standards, and the states and EPA have vast authority and discretion to determine how that's done, and costs and other implementation factors, like technological constraints, are used at that point to determine what's reasonable. This Court in Union Electric in 1976 pointed out that costs and technological considerations are amply used in the implementation process, so long as they don't avoid it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "The legislative history and the text of the '70 Act are absolutely clear, and the EPA and the D.C. Circuit have been unanimous for 30 years that in the first part of the Clean Air Act, that is in setting the standards, the EPA is to consider only what the criteria documents reveal as the effects on public health and welfare of the pollutant in the air, and that costs are determined at the implementation phase by the states, by EPA, and by Congress. Now, your point about CASAC, I think is very important to understand. The CASAC was created in the 1977 amendments, and it was directed to do two things, and it's reflected at pages 112-A and 113-A of the appendix to our petition. First, in 109(d)(2)(b) it is told to review both the criteria, which I was just discussing, and the national ambient air quality standard that EPA proposes in light of its scientific knowledge and what the criteria document reveals, and that is part of the NAAQS standard-setting process, and in this case the CASAC issued what they called closure letters, both with respect to the criteria documents on PM and ozone and with respect to the staff papers on particulate matter and ozone. You have directed my attention to a separate section of the statute which says that such committees shall also, and then it lists a series of things that it should do. That section, the section that relates to implementation technologies, et cetera relates to the implementation process of the standards. The EP -- for example, with respect to the PM and ozone standards, the CASAC has not yet issued any of that information because the Agency has not yet either begun to implement the eight-hour standard or the 2.5 standard, or indicated in notice and comment rulemaking how it will go about doing that. The provision that you have questioned, Justice O'Connor, ties in perfectly with the provision in -- also in Section 7409, I can't remember which subsection it is, which requires the EP -- or maybe it's Section 7408. In any event, I'll explain to you what I have in mind. The 1970 Act, which required EPA to set national standards for the first time under the 1967 Act, they were set by the states. In the 1967 Act, the states were told to set them by reference to two things that EPA's predecessor, HEW, would supply them. The first was the criteria document accumulating the science data on health effects, which is the same thing we have today. The second thing was a description of costs, pollution control technologies, feasibility, et cetera, and the '67 Act told the states that they were to conform their standards to both of those documents. Now in 1970, the Congress did two very significant things. First of all, it gave, it made the requirement to set standards mandatory and upon EPA, that is, on a national basis, so we would have a national floor. Then the second thing which is really significant to your question is that it separated out the two things that EPA was collecting and providing. And it provided that EPA was to still do the criteria documents, but that the NAAQS, the national standards, would be based on those criteria documents only, and the Act provides that at the time that the criteria documents are issued, EPA shall also provide to the states and to Congress information about costs, implementation, and available control technologies so that they can use that information in the standard-setting process that this Court reviewed in Union Electric."

      "speech": "The -- the -- I'm not, don't -- I'm accepting this for the sake of argument only. Don't assume it's my position. But the -- if I look at their argument on the delegation part, the nondelegation part in light of what you have just said, it seems to me that they are saying that when we look at it, specifically the health part, what we are talking about with ozone is coughing outdoor children. And if we look at coughing outdoor children we see with .09 in the air, approximately .9 of 1 percent of all the coughing outdoor children will cough and it will hurt. And if we go to .08, we get .6 of 1 percent and if we go to .07, we get .3 of 1 percent. See, it's a line they draw between points. 9, 6, 3. And they say there is no way to draw, nowhere to stop on that line. Absolutely not. Once you take all costs and these other things out of it, why are you protecting the .6 and not the .3? Why the .3, not the .9? That's, I think, what I take it is their main claim on the nondelegation point and so I would like to you respond to that directly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAXMAN",
      "speech": "I do believe it is their main point, and it is -- it fundamentally misconceives both what the Act requires and what every administrator since 1970 has done. As I was saying before, when the administrator gets the decision, it gets a staff report validated by CASAC that shows the upper bound and lower bound of where a standard should be set based on the application to the latest scientific knowledge of the standard requisite to protect public health, and in this case, you gave the ozone standard, the standard was at the upper level .09 parts per million over an eight-hour period and at the lower level, .07. Now, the question about why the administrator chose one number within that range is, of course, the question that the Court of Appeals under Section 307(b)(1) to which it will apply the arbitrary and capricious not in accordance with law standard that it has not yet done in this case, but I can articulate for you why both why no one thought the range should be below .07, that is regulating down to zero risk, and why the administrator chose .07 versus .08. I'll start with the second first to make sure that I get to the salient point. .07 was, and this is reflected in the Federal Register notice promulgating the rule at pages 38863 to 38868. .08 was chosen over .07 because one, there were no demonstrated adverse health effects below .08. Two, the average responses, even at .08 were typically small or mild. Three, the most certain effects at or below .08 were transient and reversible. Four, .07 is at or slightly above peak background levels in some locations. And five, not one single member of CASAC recommended .07 and in the legal challenges in the Court of Appeals to the standard, no party has challenged the administrator's decision not to go to .07. .07 was viewed by CASAC and the EPA staff as within the lower range because with respect to two of the six testable health effects or end points or lung function, that is, the ability to exhale, the volume you exhale in one second and symptoms, it was possible to extrapolate from studies done at and above .08 to levels all the way down to zero just by using an arithmetic extrapolation."

You are asking for a determinant criterion, but this -- this Court's precedents have not and cannot require an agency with respect to an area where there are many different pollutants, many different kinds of health effects, many different kinds of health effects and many different kinds of science and scientific uncertainty to provide that criterion.

Nor could Congress have intended for the administrator to regulate ozone and particulate matter by controlling combustion emissions from every automobile, factory, and commercial activity nationwide when again using her words, she never determined what risk is acceptable through quantification or any other metric, any other metric. This Court's decisions do not lightly presume that Congress delegated questions of such great economic and political significance to an administrative agency, nor as this Court said in Benzene, in the Benzene decision, do they allow an agency like EPA to regulate broadly across the entire economy without determining what risks are acceptable or unacceptable in an everyday common sense manner."

We do argue that there is an intelligible principle in this statute that derives from public health, from requisite to protect the public health. There are a number of other words in the statute which I may get time to deal with in my second argument but I want to focus right now on public health, because I think it brings clearly into focus what is missing from General Waxman's argument. General Waxman referred to medically significant risks and talked about the American Thoracic Society. He's talking as if the statute said we want to protect personal health. That's not what the statute says. What the statute says is we want to protect public health, and that difference is terribly significant because let me explain what happened in 1970. The Senate bill said we want to set national standards which will protect the health of persons, a term that was interchangeable in the previous Act with health of any persons. The House had a bill that said, no, we want to protect public health. Public health was a word that had been used consistently since 1955 in the statute and connoted just what, as we say in our briefs, public health does connote, which is a comprehensive cost included evaluation in order to reduce sickness and to improve longevity of the population. What the conference committee did is it accepted the House version, public health, which has a meaning which I'm going to be discussing further this morning. And what Mr. Waxman or what General Waxman has been doing this morning is referring to legislative history from the Senate bill from which he -- not just he, I don't want to blame Mr. Waxman -- but EPA has derived this notion of medically significant risks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And you've derived the notion of cost from public health. I mean, that is as obvious or not obvious, one or the other, and this regime has been going on -- Lead Industries was 1980, and this debate has been going on and yet when Congress made adjustments, it always made adjustments on the implementation end. It never did what could have been, what could have ended this debate very swiftly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "speech": "Let me start with the latter part of your question and then kind of trip back to some of the things you said previously. First of all, this is -- the Congress has taken no action with respect to Section 109(b). We all know that. There is not going to be any change by inaction by the Congress. I think surely that's common ground for everybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But there has been some action by Congress stretching out the time to achieve attainment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "speech": "But Congress has never, has never done anything to the central standard-setting provision, and it has never said anything which is different than what I'm saying about public health. And I think for a very good reason. Let me just kind of put those cases in context. I know that you had some role because you were in the Court of Appeals at the time. But Lead Industries involved a not very ubiquitous pollutant. Lead in the ambient air principally resulted from gasoline emissions which had already been regulated by EPA, and that case was tried very much as a technological feasibility case, not as a public health case such as we are talking about here. There is no doubt that the standards there protected public health in the very sense that I'm talking about in my argument this morning. The problem with the decisions following Lead Industries, it's not that Lead Industries on those facts concerning the contentions being made in that case was wrong. It is rather that the Court of Appeals then conflated the idea of technological feasibility with the question -- separate question -- of whether cost and other kinds of countervailing considerations can be taken into account in setting the standards in the first instance. Now, with respect -- and let me go ahead and say here we are with the two most ubiquitous pollutants, ozone and particulate matter, where the regulatory scheme requires everything I said in my first moments of argument this morning where we are in the last mile, and all of a sudden the question which has been present all along in public health is now front and center. Now, we talk about the implementation process here. I think two things are significant about what General Waxman had to say about this -- that this morning. First of all, I think he is conceding logically that costs must play a role or else he wouldn't be making this argument about the implementation phase. But he is misstating with all due respect what this Court's Union Electric decision said. What the Union Electric decision says is that the standards are set by EPA and they cannot be changed when EPA approves a state implementation plan. Those standards are set and whether they protect public health or not, they can't be changed in the implementation process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But I think it is the case, number one, that the implementation process, may, and I presume does, consider economics when it determines the period of time in which compliance must be reached, and of course, Congress may do that. And so that I think it's wrong on anybody's premises to say that economics is excluded from the process. Now, it may very well be that if the cost is so horrendous, that there is -- that there is no implementation period in which the cost would not be very great on an annual basis. In 20 years, it's still going to be enormously costly. I think the Solicitor General's response to that, if I understand the briefs, is that, in effect, is the decision that Congress reserved to itself by periodically taking up the question of revising implementation standards as it has, as we are going to get to, I guess, in the next case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "speech": "Justice Souter, if I may, this Court's decisions very clearly distinguish between feasibility analysis and cost/benefit analysis. Now, I will say, recognizing you said the opposite, cost in the sense of cost/benefit analysis can never be taken into account in the implementation process at all. Those standards are set, and they can't be modified in the implementation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Right. Let's assume, let's assume that is so, and I don't believe the Solicitor General will agree, but let's assume it is so. Then I think the government's answer would be Congress has set out the scheme which in effect reserves to Congress the right to revise implementation, and that's the point at which economics definitely will be given its place. But even on your kind of worst case argument, I think the government's response is that's what Congress wanted, and Congress has reserved to itself the power to interfere in the process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "speech": "First of all, I'm going to be talking about why that isn't what Congress wanted, but let me continue on the implementation part of this. What the Union Electric case says is that only the states can even look at these questions at implementation, and then they can only look at them and say who's going to bear the burden of the standards that are already set by EPA. I call it triage, but, I mean, I think you get the idea. It's essentially who's going to bear the burden."

      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "speech": "Now, but that -- first of all, I would think that it would be common ground that we don't construe statutes on the assumption that Congress will change them, and that we don't construe the words, because it seems to me when we come to the words here, we come back to what really went on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But the words that you are ultimately, the word that you are depending on is the term public health as distinct from individual health. You'll say, you say that imports. That implies an economic criterion. And I have to say even as a threshold matter, I don't know why that implies an economic criterion in some different way than a reference to or a different degree than a reference to individual health would do."
    },

      "speaker": "WARREN",

I mean, I was pressing the Solicitor General on, you know, is, is a -- is a cough too much. I don't know if a cough is too much. I suppose, you know, it's a hard call, but does it make it easier to say, well, you know, if you are going to stop a cough, you are going to -- it's going to cost $1,000 a cough. Well, I don't know.

That does not mean the agency lacks discretion. That doesn't mean, just as Justice Breyer was suggesting, that the FPC, when it sets just and reasonable rates, is pinned down to 6 cents rather than 5 cents. That's really not my argument at all.

Those are all compared- to-what kind of analyses, and they're saying you get those compared-to-what kind of analyses without having to get into economics at the front end when you're setting the standard, so they say your own argument is met."

Science helps to characterize risks, I don't doubt that. The question is, how do you manage risks? When you're managing risks you've got to take into account countervailing factors, otherwise you're in the situation that the Court of Appeals, I think, pretty aptly described."

Congress implemented instead a comprehensive and unique scheme that combines realistic expectations with measures of progress. EPA's position has changed repeatedly over the last few years, but there is no question the EPA intends to take us back to that failed approach.

What Congress put into place was the specific standard we find in subpart (2) which gives us the one-hour standard using the design value that was in place at the time of the '90 amendments. Congress did so and it made sense to do so because of the failure of the 20 years before 1990. We'd had the '70 amendments, or the '70 Act, the 1977 amendments and then leading to the '90 amendments. Attainment areas across -- there were nonattainment areas across the country and Congress got it right this time, after 20 years of failure, we've had 10 years of success.

There are certainly emission requirements to be met, a permitting review that happens on a continual basis, so the states, the areas that are in attainment are not without regulation to make sure that we continue to maintain that specific standard."

      "speech": "He did, Your Honor, and what he suggested was that once an area met the standard, that then EPA could change the standard for that specific area. That doesn't work with subpart (2) for three reasons. The first is that subpart (2) is a comprehensive scheme that applies nationwide. The second is that Section 172 of the Act takes away EPA's general authority, not just general authority with the 1-hour standard, but its general authority for classifying areas and for setting deadlines. The final reason is that subpart (2) itself in Section 181 refers to areas that are currently in attainment but may fall out of attainment. There are specific provisions in place that would apply subpart (2), and specifically table 1, to those areas. There is simply no room left, whether now, in the future, until Congress acts to change the specific standard. We've got an extraordinary case here where Congress balanced the interests, many of the interests that we're talking about this morning with respect to ozone. Congress got it right, and we're asking the Court to simply affirm the lower court's judgment that EPA may not implement the standard, but we are offering as an alternative basis that EPA cannot implement the standard because Congress gave it no authority to revise the standard in the first instance. Again, we need to look only specifically at Section 181, at the very first sentences, the sentence that provides that each area designated nonattainment for ozone shall be classified in accordance with table 1. I would be remiss if I didn't state here that we won below. A majority of the D.C. Circuit agreed the EPA had no enforcement authority to enforce a different standard. We are asking the Court to go one step further on alternative grounds, and that is that EPA cannot implement a different standard because it may not revise the standard. EPA's argument is that they cannot implement the standard because it becomes unworkable. It's unworkable because Congress never anticipated that the 1- hour standard would be changed without congressional change. Just as the states and EPA, I may remind the Court that EP -- this was EPA's bill. This was the President's bill before Congress asking for certainty, asking for a specific standard, a specific set of classifications, and specific deadlines."

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The state of Ohio is asking this Court to rule that the administrator may not revise national ambient air quality standards for ozone, and that even if she can revise them, that she cannot implement them either for primary or secondary standards. The District of Columbia Circuit held, in a judgment that no one petitioned from, that the clear language of the statute requires EPA to revise and, as appropriate, promulgate new standards for ozone, and that nothing in Section 181 in any respect impairs her ability to enforce the secondary standard, which is identical, and we think, therefore, that those questions are not properly before the Court. What is before the Court is the question of whether, having resolved the legal question before it, which is the challenge to EPA's authority to revise and provide a new standard, the Court of Appeals acted properly in going beyond that and opining, based on some preamble language, to the new rule that EPA promulgated, that EPA could either not implement the new primary standard, or implement it only in conformity with subpart (2), which are the specific implementation provisions that Congress enacted in 1990 for the 1-hour ozone standard. We think -- we have two submissions. First, there was -- the Court of Appeals did not properly address the issue of how EPA will implement the new standard that it said it had authority to set, because EPA has not undertaken any final agency action to do so, and the time for doing so has not yet come. Second of all, the question is, because it hasn't engaged in the notice and comment rulemaking about how to implement the 8-hour standard, the EPA has not -- the Court of Appeals decision is perforce phrased in terms of such a high level of abstraction that not even any of the respondents can agree what the Court of Appeals meant when it said in its third try at this that EPA may implement the 8-hour standard only in conformity with subpart (2), and therefore we think that the Court of Appeals should not have reached this issue. The administrator will engage in notice and comment rulemaking specifying how the Act is to be implemented at the time that she promulgates the area designations that the states have provided to her and sets the schedule for what are called state implementation plans, and at that point she will have issued a rule and undertaken an action supported by an explanation that this, or the Court of Appeals could review. Thank you."
