There's the insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact, and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of relationship between that contact ­­ contact and the claim.

Now, this Court has recently held that we are guided by the language of the statute. I understand that arguments have been made by my colleagues and also by the Ninth Circuit that there is a difference between invocation of immunity and attribution. This is the point I want to make. Section 1604 is the invocation section. That's the section that states that certain people, those defined as the foreign state, can invoke immunity. Section 1605 is an attribution section. It says whose acts deprive you of immunity. And because foreign state is a defined term, we are limited to the limitations in the FSIA. In the alternative, if this Court were to move away from the definition, I believe we would all agree that there has to be some element of control. The test that this Court develops for agent has to have either the degree of control in Bancec or something lesser. But all agency law requires control, and that's where the en banc court missed the mark. They didn't require any control. And if one requires control, it has to be reversed because there was no control here. If there are no pending questions, I would appreciate reserving the balance of my time for rebuttal."

But remember, they can do choice of law analysis not only in terms of ordinary common law principles that might apply in a court, but there's a number of ways that a defendant in OBB's position can protect itself in a case like this. First of all, they can put a choice of law provision in the ticket, or in the contract, or whatever might be at issue. Second of all, even as to forum, forum selection clauses can be put into tickets like this, and contracts, and in fact they are.

But if you have any doubt about that, you can note that OBB has made a personal jurisdiction argument in the district court that the district court never reached. And so that is available on remand. The only thing before this Court is sovereign immunity and whether OBB is entitled to sovereign immunity for commercial acts in this country and the teeth of a congressional statute that says in the declaration of purpose in Section 1602 that foreign states doing commercial activities in this country should not be entitled to sovereign immunity.

      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Much of our discussion today has been in separating the torts from the contractual claims here in this case, implied warranty claims. Let me tell you why I believe it's a bad idea to split claims on causes of action. This Court decided recently a case called Pimentel in which the Republic of the Philippines had sovereign immunity. But there were also a number of other defendants that did not enjoy sovereign immunity. And this Court, taking into consideration important issues such as international comity, decided that under Rule 19, the entire lawsuit had to be dismissed, including as to nonsovereign entities, in order to give full effect to the sovereign immunity of the Republic of the Philippines. In light of that holding, it would make little sense that when the defendant has the right to invoke immunity, that we would split the causes of action so that some of them would proceed in Austria and some of them would proceed in the United States."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BASOMBRIO",
      "speech": "Yes, exactly, Your Honor. And the circuit courts and the State courts have all understood what gravamen means. They know what it means. And if we just took anybody off the street here and we asked them, why is the Respondent suing, each person would say, because she was injured in a terrible accident in Austria."

    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

      "speaker": "BASOMBRIO",
      "speech": "Then we would have to ask where did the breach occur. As in Justice Kagan's question, I would answer, if the breach occurred in Austria, then the claim would arise in Austria. Now, the warranty, in terms of the duty of care, there is no duty of care until she arrives at the station and tries to board that train. And even if she didn't have a ticket at all, the record establishes that we would still owe her a duty of care."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
      "speech": "What if she also had, in addition to the claims she's asserted, a conventional breach of contract claim? She said that when they ­­ when she tried to get on the train, they said no, your Eurail Pass doesn't let you get on free, you have to pay an additional amount?"
