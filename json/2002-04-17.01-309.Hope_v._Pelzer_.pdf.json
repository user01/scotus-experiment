      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under United States v. Lanier, the law was clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity when it gives officials fair warning that their conduct is unlawful. The fair warning standard is met when a rule laid out by prior law applies with obvious clarity to the conduct in question, even if the rule arises from a case involving different facts. The materially similar facts requirement of the Eleventh Circuit is an unwarranted gloss upon the fair warning standard, just like the fundamentally similar facts requirement which this Court unanimously rejected in Lanier. It is an impermissible gloss because it emphasizes similarity of fact over clarity of ruling."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

I mean, isn't -- doesn't -- the one sort of wrapped up in the other?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I take it your position, though, is that all we have to decide is whether the substantially similar standard is the proper standard, and if we say no, it's not, that's like Lanier, which was -- what was it? -- substantially identical, I guess, wasn't it, something like that?"

      "speech": "All right. Now, if that's what we're going to get into, so we will determine what the violation was and then get to immunity with respect to that particular violation, we won't confine ourselves simply to the substantially similar verbiage, then I go back to my earlier question, and I take it -- and I think you've answered it, but I want to make sure I understand you -- for purposes of determining whether there's a constitutional violation, you are not arguing, I take it, that we should take into consideration the particular circumstances of the day, the heat, the shirt, the bathroom breaks, the water, is that correct? All we look at is the restraint itself?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "The plaintiff's affidavit is that he was left on the hitching post for 7 hours, and the fair inference that can be drawn from that is that he was restrained for 7 hours without breaks, and there's certainly no evidence rebutting that with respect to the second incident, which he was on the hitching post. The first incident he was on the hitching post, there is evidence that he was given one bathroom break, and he was taken down that incident only after 2 hours, which in itself is --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That, we got into that. That is, I think, disputed even as to the first instance because I think that the State said he had been offered other breaks but he had declined them. Well, that's one thing, and another argument that was made about the background, if we're going to get anything beyond the hitching, that the particular officers' names were not involved in some of the worst aspects of that. That is, the officers that are named defendants here didn't tell Hope to take off his shirt, and didn't pour water in front of him and have the dogs drink it. Those were other people who are not named defendants, and you don't contest that, do you?"

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "speech": "We do not know that, Your Honor, although we do know that it was their expectation that he be restrained indefinitely.

      "speech": "And the allegation is that this prisoner refused to work in one case, and disrupted a work crew in another case, and according to the prison policy -- I mean, you have to do something when he does that. To take him back and say, oh, you know, you've got to go back to prison, he says yes, that's exactly what I want. What was the prison supposed to do?"

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speech": "At least the case in the Eleventh Circuit, because it wasn't in the case. It wasn't in the case before the district court. It was -- in the district court it was just restraint as punishment. The idea of this being a temporal measure to get him to go back to work doesn't show up till the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit rejects it because it wasn't raised in the district court."

Collier did not exist, in that case, a reasonable officer -- the question would be, what would a reasonable officer -- what would have been clear to a reasonable officer. The reasonable officer could have made a colorable argument that the appropriate analysis is the deliberate indifference standard established by this Court's decision in Farmer v. Brennan, that standard being whether the officer was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm. The reasonable officer could further have concluded that neither the May incident in this case nor the June incident in this case presented a substantial risk of serious harm."

      "speaker": "SCHLICK",
      "speech": "Yes, we think it would be sufficient to establish a substantive violation of the Eighth Amendment, although as the facts must be taken here, qualified immunity would attach, because there's a colorable argument that the threshold was not crossed, but I'd want to say that this Court has not resolved whether it's this deliberate indifference standard or rather the Hudson v. McMillian test, the excessive force test of whether force was used maliciously and sadistically to inflict harm, and that is an unresolved question, is, it's -- that is that very absence of certainty that would be most relevant absent the Gates v. Collier decision. In this --"

      "speaker": "SCHLICK",
      "speech": "The overarching question of whether the pain was wanton and unnecessary would focus on the degree of pain, the penalogical justification, and the threat to the inmate's safety, so you would need to know the facts that bear on those inquiries. In this case, as I've said, the Eleventh Circuit decision of Gates v. Collier was directly on point. It provided sufficient certainty for the officers here, and it was correct in that as applied to these facts, under this Court's decisions, there was an Eighth Amendment violation."

      "speech": "Well, the proposition for which petitioner's amici wish this Court to read Gates and say that our respondents should have read Gates is this very broad proposition that any form of restraint as a form of punishment is unconstitutional, although that proposition has clearly been narrowed not just by the Eleventh Circuit's rulings and rulings in Williams v. Burton and Ort, which indicated that certainly in an excessive force context you could restrain a prisoner for a period of time, but also by this Court's rulings in Wilson v. Seiter and Whitley v. Albers, and the clarifying ruling in Farmer v.

Petitioner never alleged or presented evidence that it was used as a form of punishment. That phrase does not appear anywhere in his first affidavit or his second affidavit. He simply says that he was put on the bar, and our respondents put him on the bar not to punish him, per se, but because he was refusing to work under the regulation."

      "speaker": "FORRESTER",
      "speech": "Well, first of all we think that the Court's entitled to take judicial notice of it, because it is the law, that you don't have to actually introduce the law into the record, but on top of that, it was always in the mix. The district court -- the activity log for the petitioner's first day on the bar is a copy of the log that comes from the appendix to the regulations."

That is, his allegation is that he was left for 7 hours on a very hot day with his arms about over his head, standing up, and given no water, except once, so there are 3 hours at least without any water. All right, that's his allegation. Now, introduce any regulation you want, why doesn't that create an issue for trial?"

Did you move, did you say -- did you say -- I don't see in these papers in front of me, say that the reason we're entitled to summary judgment is, it was ordinary practice to let the person go off, and then you'd cite that, and here they're following ordinary practice. Now, maybe then they'd have to have replied, but I couldn't find anything like that. Where does it say that in the trial court?"

Now, is there a case that would confuse what I think would be ordinary common sense on that -- at least, or tell me why that isn't ordinary common sense to think that that is very cruel, and certainly an unusual thing to do."

Jim Gates, who is one of the respondents here, was a defendant in this case, and in this case the prisoner alleged that he was put on the bar for 8 hours in 95-degree heat, which is hotter than this case, was not given any water, was not given any bathroom breaks, which has not been alleged in this case. The district court, or rather the magistrate judge appointed counsel for this pro se litigant, instructed counsel to go out and provide supplemental briefing on the question of whether that circumstance violated a clearly established right, and the court said, I have done my own diligent search -- this is on page 89 -- the court has made a diligent search of the case law, I requested additional brief from the parties, and neither the court nor the parties have identified any cases binding or otherwise in this circuit in which it was found that the Eighth Amendment as violated in these circumstances.

I mean, I would note that even in the absence of the regulation the district court didn't find his allegations in evidence sufficient to make out a claim that would withstand qualified immunity, so introducing that only makes the case all that stronger, but I would hasten to add that the Court did make a finding that he was put on the bar because he was disruptive to the work crew -- work squad. That is the condition in the regulations. He was not put on the bar for a strictly punitive purpose in the sense that petitioners are arguing --"

We're not saying that it shouldn't be analyzed as to whether it's cruel and unusual, but in the narrow sense in which they are using it, and in the narrow sense in which Ort v. White sought to distinguish punishment from what it termed an immediately necessary coercive measure, this requires --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why doesn't the -- Ort, which you say he's the magistrate on page 89 and 90, supports your position. Interestingly enough, that case is cited by the Government in support of its position, and I suppose the reason is because they make very clear in that case that it was unusual to deprive a person of water, and in that circumstance, absolutely necessary, and so how, in this circumstance, was it necessary to do what he says they did? I was deprived of water, was teased by two officers when I asked for water, on one occasion they started to bring me water but ended up giving it to some dogs, I was given some once or twice during 7 hours, but that was not enough, and at one point during the hottest part of the day I was left without water for at least 3 hours. All right, so for a person reading the case of Ort, and then reading that, you would think that Ort actually supports the Government, not you, because -- unless, of course, there's some reason that behavior like that, if it occurred, would have been necessary, so what is the necessity, or what can you say about it?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "That's, of course, what you say, but what the allegation says is that it was your three respondents. In -- on -- in the affidavit what he says specifically on that is, he says, I believe that the officer who actually put me on the hitching post was defendant Sergeant Mark Pelzer. However, a report says I was put there by defendant Gates, and an officer named Mark Dempsey, and then McClaran wrote the report, and in McClaran's reply he suggests he was there, and so I don't see any denial here by your particular clients that they were not responsible for this, and he alleges they were."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

The second day was not when Pelzer put him on the bar, but it is no way clear from that that either Pelzer or Gates, who it would appear put him on the bar, stuck around after that."

The point I'm trying to respond to is their contention basically that there was no valid penalogical purpose for putting him on the restraining bar, that this was somehow arbitrary or retaliative, or retributive and not remedial, which was the purpose. The purpose here was to get him to go back to work. It wasn't --"

They took me away from the work site. In one case I was having a fight with somebody, but in neither case did I say, I won't work. This was not a man who said, I want to be back in my cell watching the television and not working."

      "speaker": "FORRESTER",

      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We believe this case is controlled by any of three common sense principles of law, each of which is essential if this Court's qualified immunity doctrine is to prevent the problems that it was designed to prevent. The first is that where personal liability is at stake, public officials shouldn't be expected to be more adept at construing case law than the State court judges whose decisions are reviewed in Federal habeas proceedings. Now, the United States appears to adopt a standard that would be equivalent functionally to the standard that this Court has already adopted in the habeas context, and we think the United States' argument in this point is correct, and in fact we believe the Court has already come close to adopting that standard in the Saucier decision, which said the proper inquiry is whether the case on which a plaintiff relies occurred, and I quote, under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from the facts presented in the case at hand. It seems to me that is just another way of saying that the facts of the two cases can't be materially indistinguishable."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHAERR",
      "speech": "Well, it seems to me, Justice Souter, the way you answer that question is, you look at the case law, and that's what at issue here. There's no allegation that the text of the Eighth Amendment or that any statute bars the conduct at issue here."

      "speaker": "SCHAERR",

Well, that's the exact -- that's exactly the same phrase that's used in the habeas statute, and that this Court has interpreted in Williams and Penry II as meaning materially indistinguishable, and it would be useful, and I think quite productive to apply that in this context as well, and would bring greater clarity to the law."

      "speaker": "SCHAERR",
      "speech": "Sure, but -- and I agree the two situations are not entirely identical, but if anything it seems to me the section 1983 context raises even greater federalism concerns, because as this Court recognized a couple of terms ago in Geyer v. Honda, litigation can often be the functional equivalent of a statutory -- of a statute or a regulation, and so what happens in the 1983 context, as illustrated in this case, is that courts articulate broad rules that purport to govern the conduct, the day-to-day conduct of elected and nonelected State officials, and so it seems to me if anything the federalism concerns are greater. In another important way, public officials, nonlawyer, nonjudge public officials are at a disadvantage and that, as this Court noted in Saucier, and I quote, public officials are often forced to make split-second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving, unlike judges, who can take all the time they want sometimes to --"

That is, their actions can't be objectively cruel, but they also -- they also cannot act with a subjective awareness of a serious harm to the inmates, and it seems to me that's the key distinction in this case between Gates, or the key reason why Gates is not controlling here. Gates was decided long before Whitley and Farmer and all of those decisions that made clear the subjective requirement in the Eighth Amendment, and indeed if you look at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, there's not even a finding of any awareness of serious harm that would come to these inmates. They just completely overlooked the serious harm requirement, and so it seems to me Gates, based on this court's current cases, Gates is easily distinguishable, and can't be taken as controlling here.

Well, not just Farmer, but Farmer and the other decisions that preceded it added a requirement of subjective awareness of a risk of serious harm. Gates didn't impose that kind of requirement at all, and therefore once this Court's decisions made clear that that subjective requirement was present, Gates, it seems to me, could no longer be regarded as controlling in this situation, even if you interpret Gates on its own terms. as the petitioner would have you."

Indeed, as Justice Ginsburg recognized in her concurrence in that case, the evidentiary predicate for denying qualified immunity must consist of what Rule 56(e) calls specific facts set forth in affidavits or other similar evidence. General allegations are not enough, in the summary judgment context, even though they might be on a motion to dismiss."
