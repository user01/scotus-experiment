    "speech": "We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 105 on our original docket, Kansas v. Colorado. General Six."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article III makes a clear distinction between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction, and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress is not granted the same power over original jurisdiction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "That's an extremely sensitive clause in Article III. We can decide this case without relying on the distinction you just discussed, can't we?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, I think can you, and the Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and avoid that constitutional conflict. And I think the stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very result. The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28 U.S.C. section 1920, states: \"A judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following.\" And it lists six subparagraphs, including subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for Printing and Witnesses. The statute has two terms in it that are defined, \"judge\" and \"court of the United States,\" and, importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and that is \"Justice of the United States.\" \"Justice of the United States\" is defined as \"the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court.\" The cost provision says \"a judge.\" \"Judge of the United States\" is defined as including judges on the court of appeals, the district court, the Court of International Trade, essentially the listed courts and the Article III judges."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE",
    "speech": "But, on the other hand, \"court of the United States\" is defined specifically to include the Supreme Court. So you have a contradiction no matter which way you flip it. On the one hand, it says \"judge,\" which does not include the Justices of the Supreme Court. On the other hand, it says \"court of the United States,\" which does include the Supreme Court. So why should we pick one -- one answer to the contradiction rather than the other?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "You don't have to pick. And you're correct, \"the court of the United States\" is defined to include the Supreme Court. But the strongest reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who appears in the court of the United States. And if you think about it, there's a circle of judges that are defined here and a circle of courts that are defined here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a judge and in the court of the United States, the statute should apply."

    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "And that --"

    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It also says \"clerk.\" We may not be judges, but we certainly have a clerk."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "You do, and 28 U.S.C. section 1911, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals with the Supreme Court Clerk. And throughout title 28, the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower courts."

    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I don't think the Court would refer to the general cost statute in its original jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from Congress. 28 U.S.C. 19 --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, but let's assume that we think Congress can control this, this issue, this question. Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without reference to 1920."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I mean, I would -- if your assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant of the discretion the Court already has. They are turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have the clerk set costs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "If I think this case is controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "No. I don't believe you have to refer to 1920."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Why can't you rest your case just on 1911?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Because in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given power to make exceptions or regulations over original jurisdiction. And in the 219 years of the Court's original practice, they have never referred to a congressional cost provision, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Are you saying that 1911 doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not included within the term \"other necessary disbursements\"?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I believe the expert witness fees in this case were vital to the resolution. They were --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Were they within 1911?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I don't believe they were other incidental disbursements. That's not our position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Other necessary disbursements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Other necessary disbursements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Incidental to the case. You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "If -- if this Court determines that Congress has the power, and it's done so through -- since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I certainly would accept that position as the result. However, I would point out to the Court that I think the expert witness costs and the work was vital to the resolution of the case here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "If you're reading of the statute is correct, then I take it we would have the discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert fees. Is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",
    "speech": "If that's so, why shouldn't we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert fees that are available in case of the original jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the expert fees that would be available in a district court? Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why should there be -- why should we as a discretionary matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically different fees depending on the court in which the case originates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Clearly the Court has the power to make that rule for original cases. However, the original jurisdiction was developed when the States agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the sovereign States. And as the Court said in Florida v. Georgia in 1854, \"The analogies and rules and foundations of law that apply to private parties are not necessarily a good fit for sovereign States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, but Justice Alito is saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have guidance from Congress. They have adhered to the $40 a day limit in very important cases; why don't we just say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Because what Colorado's position is that they are telling you that the Special Master's hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that would save $40 a day."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "We are saying it's our discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and so forth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Clearly, the Court would have the power to do that. However, there has only been approximately 200 original jurisdiction cases in the 219 years of the Court. To suggest that the rules --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "In all those -- in all those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a witness? I mean, courts of the United States, district courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses as distinguished from party's witnesses. Do you know if that's happened in Special Master situations?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I can tell you it didn't happen in this case. I certainly can't speak to whether it's happened in other cases involving special masters, so I don't know the answer to that. Certainly 1920 makes a distinction for court- appointed experts rather than the expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920. I think the important point to consider, though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its 219 years of developing essentially an interstate common law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position: You have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920, which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you you're limited to $40 a day."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "How do Special Master fees work? The Special Master always has fees and the parties I think usually divide them. How does that -- how is their authority to order them --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Sure. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure deals with special masters in the lower courts. It has no application here and wasn't used. The Special Master's fees, which total approximately a million dollars, just shy of that, were resolved by the parties after the Special Master was allowed to exercise discretion on that area of cost."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Well, what if they hadn't -- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?"
  },

    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "If they hasn't resolved the Special Master's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Yes. How would the -- how would the Special -- what would be the authority of this Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X dollars?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, I think the authority of the Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master to handle the case and to do the specific things that were --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Okay. We just, we just regressed one step. Where does the authority come from?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "To appoint a Special Master?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "It's an inherent authority the Court has in original jurisdiction cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "So that the authority to compensate is inherent?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "The authority to compensate is inherent. In the Judiciary --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Are you making -- would you make an inherent authority argument here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Regardless of original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to in effect to decree these sorts of claims."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, again there is a distinction between appellate and original and, focusing on original, I think the Court has entirely the authority. The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court exclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set forth any procedures to govern the disputes. That's always been carefully preserved to the discretion of the Court to apply each unique case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "General Six, under your reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the Court have authority to charge your fees to your adversary, shift attorney's fees?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Yes. In the original jurisdiction the Court would have the inherent authority to do fee-shifting if the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Did you make such a request in this case? Why should -- why should attorney's fees be treated differently from expert witness fees? Let me put it that way. Or should it be treated differently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "The Special Master should have the discretion to consider all the costs and unique circumstances of the case. In this case we chose expert witness fees --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "We should have the discretion. Why do you keep talking about the Special Master? He's just -- he's just our amanuensis. Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "It is, and the benefit of having the Special Master make a recommendation is we could have gone through these different categories of costs and come up with a recommendation. The Court certainly could have learned --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I take it the usual practice is for the parties to settle this matter and submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "The way it's worked in this case is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the Special Master's fees. The Special Master suggested it wouldn't be unfair to award them two-thirds Colorado, one-third Kansas. After that the parties resolved it, just like we resolved every other issue of cost where the Special Master was allowed to apply that discretion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So why didn't -- - then are we here? We are talking about limited amounts. So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special Master fees this is what we are going to agree to. It doesn't have to be limited to $40. You can agree as part of a global settlement to whatever you want."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, the Special Master's fees we resolved. The experts fees at issue here, of course that bright-line rule was drawn by the Special Master and he never was allowed to make a recommendation to the Court to consider that. In balancing -- the remedies in these cases are highly equitable remedies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "Would you just answer my question of a moment ago. Why should expert witness fees be treated differently from attorney's fees?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, in this case they should be treated differently because the model at issue that the experts for Kansas developed, the HI model, was used to prove our claims at trial, which would have --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "You used lawyers to prove your case, too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Excuse me?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "You used lawyers to prove your case, too. Why should they not be compensated?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Because we considered the special circumstances of the model. It proved the claims at trial. It was adopted by the Court in 2004 in Kansas v. Colorado to monitor compliance in the Arkansas River Basin. It's the water use -- it's applied by the Colorado State water use rule. So it was special features like that that we wanted to present to the Special Master to explain why the fees should be fairly balanced and divided in a way other than he did."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE STEVENS",
    "speech": "I don't understand that to be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's fees."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, in a particular case where perhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed or some other situation developed, fee shifting may be appropriate. In this case we felt the expert model we developed was so vital that it would be persuasive to the Special Master and fair and equitable to award it to us."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Do you know whether any other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question, what the practice had been, but with respect to expert fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "In original cases the Court has never referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutes discussed in Crawford Fitting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But have they ever approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for the expert witness that deviates from the $40?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I think the answer to that is yes and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v. New York in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the Delaware River. And the Court pointed out in that opinion that a mass of evidence was presented to the Special Master, and on costs the Court said: \"The cost of the cause shall be divided 35 percent to New Jersey, 35 to City of New York,\" and so on. The \"cost of the cause\" I would argue is the cost to get the case to the point where it was resolved. In the boundary dispute --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Do you know -- do you know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "It does not say in the published opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is. However, from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do that without experts. But I would point the Court to the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers, historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes equally between the States -- not each State to bear their own cost, but divided them equally. And the -- the experts that are involved in resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of experts that we used in this case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "You're right. They are all different. They did a lot of work on that. I -- I know they did a lot of work on this. Congress has a statute, and the statute is: We don't care if the witness is Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local zookeeper. Okay. We don't care. We don't care if they did a lot of work or a little work. We want them to be paid $40 a day, period. It's too much trouble to figure out how much work they did. That's what we want. That's the law. Now, Justice Alito said: I agree with you for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule. But I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; still, why shouldn't we follow it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Because in the original cases the Court has always tried to reach an equitable balance --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Have do you any example where Congress had a statute which says every court in the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that number is; it's $382.50, okay. Now, despite that clear statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a different amount. Is there any such case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I'm not aware of that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Okay. And is there anything in the -- in the nature of litigation? And there might be. I'm not asking it as a rhetorical question. Is there anything in the nature of original jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, or to do other things that would complicate it? I'm not speaking of your case. You have a wonderfully strong case in your case. I want to know about in general, in original actions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I would suggest the only difference is the parties. And the Court in its 219 years --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "If anything, the parties are in a better position to pay the money than the average person."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, I assume -- I assume your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert Einstein is ridiculous. And, therefore, if it's up to us, we would adopt a different rule. Isn't that your answer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "That's exactly my answer. And if you think -- if Congress can adopt a congressional --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, I'm not sure that answer is -- is at all adequate. Number one, what is there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so different about this case? Let's say one landowner secretly and intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and -- and he has no legal right to do that. And the only way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, very expensive expert, a hydrologist. And by the time he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit of the damages. Congress has said too bad. That's the way it is. Why isn't it that way with States, especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can really afford the -- afford it better than the landowner. What's the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "The difference is the Court has indicated for original cases: These are such disputes of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations that the model case for even taking a case is where the acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type of thing that would lead to war."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I haven't seen -- I mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does it? I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to spend the day appearing in court worth being called an \"expert\" for $40. I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just repeating Justice Scalia's question. The fact that Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in reality doesn't mean that we should do the same."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I would agree. The special master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million dollars. The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas had amounted to approximately $30,000. So that different there, I think, demonstrates the very unfairness --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "It's not unfair to have a rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or lose. That's the rule, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I don't think that's the rule in original jurisdiction cases. At least the Court has never said that. The Court has --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "If you lose this case, if we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his own experts. Is that right or wrong?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "I think that's correct, but we didn't lose. And the Court found that Kansas proved that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 50 years by clear and convincing evidence. But one point I'd like to make --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, can we do this then? I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to pay the winning side's lawyers."

    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "The Court would have that ability to do that in original jurisdiction --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, should we do that, too? If we are going to have them pay the experts, why don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' fees? That would be quite a revolution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Because in the original jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and historically awarded the prevailing party costs. And if Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost, Congress could pass a statute that says: You have to take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use special masters, or you can't use certain special masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "Well, as the case progressed, the special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50. At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested reasons and special circumstances that should allow the special master to apply discretion. He then suggested it wouldn't be unfair to award the special master fee costs two-thirds Colorado, one-third Kansas because of the unique features of the case. And the parties then settled the special master fees with that guidance."

    "speech": "Of course, I think you gave the answer earlier. Rule 53 allows for the -- an order to say that one or both parties shall pay the special master fee. So if we are going to follow other analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. It's under Rule 53. Of course, you say we don't have to follow that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were to look to congressional and -- and to other rules."

And the Court never even enacted an original action rule until 1939, so after 150 years. And in 1939 the Court enacted Rule 5, which just set up the bare minimums of commencing the action. And Rule 17 today has essentially the same framework that tells the parties how to start the action but reserves all the other rules to the discretion of the special master. It does point to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Evidence as guides but not binding, mandatory rules that tie the Court's hand."

It provides that a witness in attendance at any court of the United States shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in addition to travel and accommodation allowances. Section 451 of Title 28 defines \"court of the United States\" to include this Court, the Supreme Court of the United States, and that definition has been part of the statute since 1948.

In other words, one reason that we were given original jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution. I think it would be surprising if you told the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would be surprising.

As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40 applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a determination of a particular item under section 1920: Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may tax its cost. My question is this. One of the items covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk may tax, is fees of the clerk. Under section 1911, which relates entirely to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk. That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the Supreme Court of the United States. Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section 1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there is no statute on it at all? But the main point is unless 1911 is totally redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the Supreme Court."

Okay. So the thing is, you can't pay money in the United States unless have you some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court some authorization to fix fees. Now we look back at 1821. And 1821 tells you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day. Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more. Just says that's what he is entitled to. Now of course, in the lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no authority to pay him more. But in the Supreme Court, there is authority to pay him more. That comes out of 1911. I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem of whether Congress can start legislating the details of original jurisdiction rules and so forth. Just -- there is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent ourselves from going down that road. That's -- I'm deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of this gimmick?"

I find it very interesting that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the process and mode of proceeding in original jurisdiction cases as fully as in other Federal courts, but that the omission to legislate such process does not deprive the Court of its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction.

As I understand it, you're -- when you answered it, in a situation in which the slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, you're using \"inherent power\" in effect to be a kind of default power. If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has got to do something. That's got to be us, so -- so we would have the authority. But you are not using the term \"inherent power\" in the sense of being a power which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress in any respect. Is that correct?"

    "speech": "That's correct, Justice Souter, to the extent that there was nothing applicable to this and it came before you, should expert witnesses get compensated some -- some amount, Congress hasn't spoken on it, I would think, as a matter of default, you could say yes. And -- but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOUTER",
    "speech": "Do you think there is -- there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court -- just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could not eliminate?

Because if in fact parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of business that the Court ought to be engaged in."

    "speaker": "SUTHERS",

He has been fair, competent, and conscientious in resolving all the issues before this Court, including this issue of expert witness fees. It was the plain language of the statute and the clear direction of the case law that led him to his conclusion that the expert witnesses' fees were limited by statute in this case. We would ask you to deny Kansas's exception to the final report, and that the Court should enter the proposed judgment and decree. Mr. Chief Justice. If there are no other questions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument."

    "speaker": "SIX",
    "speech": "1920 didn't appear in 1948 magically. It came from the 1853 Fee Act. And the language in the Fee Act was, \"A judge shall tax costs.\" \"A judge\" -- it says, \"Costs shall be taxed by a judge or clerk of the court.\" I'm sorry. And 1920 says, \"A judge or clerk of any court of the United States.\" In 1853, as the Court has discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, the Fee Act applied to the circuit courts. It says that in its title. And \"judge\" in 1853 meant a lower court judge. In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- \"a judge\" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing. Under Colorado's reading \"court of the United States\" would expand to read \"judge\" right out of the statute, and it would make the statute apply to \"magistrate judge,\" for example, which is not included in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe and presides over a court of the United States, and it would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28 defines \"Justices\" as a separate group. So that's not --"

The only thing they have added is a definition of \"court of the United States.\" And if after 168 years, Congress is going to tread on the Court's original jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement rule that would require Congress to say, \"We are going to do this now. We've never done it in our history, but now after 168 years we are.\" Not only that, Colorado's position relies on the fact that they did this in 1948, and it's gone unnoticed by the Court, any major treatise, or commentary --"
