      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The National Labor Relations Act confers organizational, representational, and bargaining rights on employees, broadly defined, including professional employees, but it expressly excludes supervisors from that protected class. The term, supervisors, is defined in section 211 of the Act, which is set forth on page 2 of our brief, or also on page 2 of our petition, and to be a supervisor under this provision an employee must have authority in the interest of the employer to perform one of 12 specified supervisory functions, or effectively to recommend that such action be taken, and the employee's exercise of that authority must not be of a merely routine or clerical nature, but must require the use of independent judgment. In 1994, in NLRB v. Health Care and Retirement Corporation, this Court held that the board had mistakenly applied a special test of supervisory status for the health care industry based on an incorrect interpretation of the phrase, in the interest of the employer. The Court held that the board had set up a false dichotomy between action taken in connection with patient care and action taken in the interest of the employer, which is in the business of patient care, and in so doing, the Court did not at all suggest that the problem of reconciling the coverage of professional employees with the exclusion of supervisors was an insuperable one for the board. It suggested some possible approaches that might result in a defensible solution. It specifically agreed with the proposition that phrases in section 211 such as independent judgment and responsibly to direct, are ambiguous, and the board needs to be given ample room to apply them to different categories of employees."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So there were those three phrases that could possibly justify the exclusion of registered nurses generally, and one of them was disposed of in the earlier case. There are two left, independent judgment, and responsibly to direct, but the Government has chosen not to put both in play in the present case, right? Only independent judgment is at issue here, so that if you lose on this one, you still have the third swing, right?"
    },

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Yes, of course, but the board made a determination that responsibly to direct in the abstract need not be defined because it is always qualified by the exercise of independent judgment not of a routine nature in order for these determinations to be made, and early on, after Taft-Hartley was passed, the board got burned by courts of appeals in trying to interpret responsibly to direct, particularly in a case called Ohio Power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "The trouble is that hanging it all on independent judgment is -- that's much the broader way to go. I think that suggests that no professional exercises independent judgment if he is acting on the basis of knowledge that is peculiar to his profession, or her profession, in the case of nurses, for the most part. What -- you really think you can sustain that position?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, the board I think quite properly on the basis of textual analysis of this provision holds that there must be a nexus between the exercise of independent judgment and the exercise of one of the 12 categories of authority that define who is a supervisor, because that is what is qualified by the phrase, requiring the exercise of independent judgment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But your basic position is that professional judgment is not independent judgment, that if something is required to be done, and any qualified professional would do it that way, this is not independent judgment. It comes closer to routine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, the -- if we're talking about when an employee is performing his own functions, his trade or his profession, carrying out his own tasks, that is not one of the functions that makes one a supervisor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but let me give you a hypothetical, one that concerns me. Let's say that you have a registered nurse in charge of a health care facility, and one of her tasks is to assign the other health care personnel to one or another patient. She says, we need more help here. This patient is in more need of help. The other patient is in less need of help. That seems to me to be supervisory activity, even though it is based upon her medical expertise. That's opposed to the situation in which the registered nurse is merely supervising one of the practical nurses in the care of a particular patient, and she says, you know, put a bandage here, you know, or give him two aspirins. There, you're not directing the employee to one task or another. You're telling that employee how to do the task that employee is doing. Well, if the registered nurse is really assigning all of the people, and saying, we need three more over here, we need two more down there, I don't know why that is not supervisory work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, assignment is a separate category in this, but let me respond more directly to your question. If the nurse did not have anyone assisting her and had to decide which patient was in more acute need of care, the nurse would be making a professional judgment and carrying it out. If the nurse has an extra pair of hands available with which the nurse has to communicate by more than brain waves in order to exercise the same professional responsibility, and this is a less-skilled employee, and the direction to that employee once that professional determination has been made falls into the category of routine, in giving the directions to the assistant, so that it would be in -- for purposes of dividing labor and management, which is what this is about, in the category that also would include the journeyman directing his apprentice --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Sure, I understand. I'm not sure where you came out on the hypothetical I gave you. Is that nurse who is assigning other health care personnel to one patient or another, on the basis of her expert medical judgment of which patients need help more, is she in a supervisory position, or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes. No, no. It's her independent judgment. The owner of the home tells her, you know, we have 30 personnel here, and you know, some of them are in this ward, some in that ward. We don't know which ones are -- should be where. It's up to you to assign them where they should be."

Maybe that would be better. Give us examples of RN's under this test who would not qualify as employees, but would be excluded as supervisors."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, it was stipulated that the nursing coordinator here, who had authority to hire and fire, and made staffing decisions about who would be working in the wings of this facility was a supervisor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Isn't that just the question that Justice Scalia asked about staffing, making staffing decisions, who goes to which ward?"

      "speech": "If it became comparable to that, yes. I mean --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I thought in this very case, and maybe I'm wrong, but there is a mechanism whereby there's a registered nurse who's the building supervisor when the other folks aren't there, and that that amounts to about 72 percent of the time, in terms of total hours that the building is open, 24 hours a day, and there is an internal memo which states that these registered nurses, as building supervisors, are in charge of the facility, and all rehabilitation staff, and are ultimately responsible for quality patient care. Now, why isn't that using independent judgment? I have a hard time understanding why a person under those instructions, who is in charge, and the only person there at the building, isn't exercising independent judgment under your proposal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, there's also a finding that these registered nurses usually work on their own, without any assistance in performing their duties, and the other employees who may be present -- we're talking about the evening hours when less is going on, are -- do not report to the nurse, whether she's the building supervisor or not, and are performing tasks that are laid out for them by management in the facility, so of course she would be using judgment in performing her own nursing services, to the extent they're called for. But what the board found in this case, the regional director found in the representation hearing, was that all that the building supervisor designation meant in practice was that she was to try to see to it that prescribed numbers of staff, and we're talking about rather small numbers, were met, previously prescribed staffing --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Wallace, I am less concerned about, you know, the outcome of this case, whether these particular nurses were, indeed, supervisory, as I am with the rationale that the board used, and the rationale that it used -- I'll quote it from your brief. It is that an employee's exercise of ordinary, professional or technical judgment in directing less- skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employer's specified standards is not the exercise of independent judgment. Now, if that's the principle on which the board is proceeding, it seems to me that would say that in the hypothetical I gave you before, that nurse, who is using her expert judgment to direct the less-skilled employees, you go here, you go there, she would not be a supervisory personnel, because she's using her professional judgment to know, you know, which medical services are needed where, and it seems to me she is a supervisor, on any reasonable analysis. In other words, I think maybe you have to take the third swing, and go back and, you know, try to resolve this case under the remaining test, which is, what is it, authority to direct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, what -- that standard that we've articulated was based on longstanding board experience with other employment situations involving skilled crafts, team leaders, lead men, group members, who they on their experience, or their superior technical knowledge, direct discrete tasks to be performed by other members of the group that management has assigned to be members of that team. They're not deciding for themselves who should be members of the team to perform the function. This has come up in a wide variety of --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But most supervisors don't necessarily decide who shall compose the people that they're going to supervise. That's usually a given by management."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "That's precisely my point, Mr. Chief Justice, that management is deciding who the team shall be and who shall be in the position of the leader."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why should the fact that management gives you a team of, say, 30, be fatal to your position as a supervisor, the fact that you don't pick them yourself? That can't be right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, if you're exercising one of the 12 kinds of supervisory authority, of course you would be a supervisor, regardless of whether management prescribed the team, but that's one indication of the limited role that the team leader is playing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, doesn't this turn on what the authority to direct consists of? If all the supervisor has -- the purported supervisor has authority to do is to tell the mechanic, no, turn the screw clockwise, not counterclockwise, okay, if that's all he has authority to do, you're turning the screw the wrong way, that's not supervision. But if, on the basis of his expert knowledge, he says, listen, I want you to go over to this other job which needs immediate assistance, I want to take three fellows off of this job, put them over there, that's supervision, and -- but that's not the basis on which the board decided this case. It decided it on the basis that there's no independent judgment when you're using your professional standards, and that seems to me to be much too broad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, it is qualified by the degree of discretion that the particular skilled employee or professional is given, and the degree to which the exercise of any direction to others or assignment of people who had been put on the shift to discrete tasks is cabined by standards both express and implicit in the --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I thought that what Justice Scalia is talking about is not really involved in this case, so I must not understand it, because I thought there were three separate things. One is a situation where you have a carpenter, and he has an assistant carpenter. Now, the assistant carpenter may tell the carpenter a lot of things, all about carpentry, and if that's what's going on, that isn't supervision, because they're experts, they're carpenters, and as long as they're talking about carpentry, that falls within the rule we're talking about. Am I right? And that describes the relationship between the registered nurse and the licensed practical nurse. The licensed practical nurse does things, gives shots or whatever, so that's the expertise point, but I thought this case primarily involved two other things. One is, what does the woman do who is the nurse, let's say, during the night hours? Now, if she's ordering building people around, like maintenance people or others, maybe she's a supervisor, but there was a finding she did nothing. She's just there, doing her nurse's job. And then there was a second thing. It isn't quite true she does nothing. In fact, she can call in substitutes, but when she calls in the substitutes, they don't have to come, or she has little discretion there. Now, that I thought was the key question. When she deals with those substitutes who are coming in when there's a shortage, that if I'm right, that doesn't have much to do with that aspect of the case that Justice Scalia's talking about. That's a little long, but that's how I was seeing it, and I'd like you to correct me if I'm wrong."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may briefly mention a couple of other hypotheticals along the spectrum which may shed some light on what the board has to decide here, supposing a nurse either has a broken arm, or has her hands tied up with another patient, and another -- and a different patient needs something administered that requires two hands, and she directs someone to do that, even selecting from among the staff assigned to her someone that she knows knows how to do that, that would be very similar to the team leader, the skilled electrician or carpenter who is doing one thing and asks another man of his team to do the other thing that's required. Moving much more toward management on the spectrum, if the nurse is anticipating a difficult night, and can authorize someone to stay overtime in addition to the regular staff, and therefore commit the employer's resources to decide how the business should be run, rather than what happens here, just seeing to it that the preordained head count is met, that would move the judgment much more toward the managerial side along the spectrum. Perhaps it would move back a bit if this discretion were cabined by rather specific criteria from the employer. The task of the board is to place these various fact-intensive situations, and we've shown them in many other areas of the workforce, to place them accurately along this spectrum and to decide where the line is to be drawn, and if there is to be coherence in the administration of the Act in this respect, it is important that when the board reasonably does so the court defer rather than second-guess those judgments."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Mr. Wallace, I agree with that, but my -- again, my problem is, why is it that the phrase, independent judgment, is the key to distinguishing among those various hypotheticals? Why is that the key? Independent of what? I gather the Government's position is, independent of the professional expertise of the individual, and I don't see how that distinguishes among the various hypotheticals along the spectrum that you've described."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Independent of managerial directives, or the implicit understanding of the way that particular supervisory functions should be utilized, because the same question arises with respect to the function of assigning, with respect to the function, other functions that appear in section 211."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "No, but with respect, it's not independent of managerial judgment, because even in the case where, in the first hypothetical, where she clearly is not supervisory, she's just telling another nurse to do this or that, that's independent of the managerial judgment. It's her judgment as to whether this nurse should do this or that, so it isn't independent of managerial judgment. The position of the Government has been that it has to be independent of her professional expertise, and for the life of me I can't understand how that has anything to do with distinguishing among these various hypotheticals."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "speech": "Well, because the exercise of her own professional expertise in carrying out her professional tasks is not one of the 12 functions of a supervisor, and the judgment that she's exercising in selecting the helping hands, if it's merely of a routine nature within the meaning of the other part of the independent judgment clause, would not make her a supervisor. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

If you read the definition that they have of independent judgment, and I would really address this and tell the -- suggest to the Court that you pay attention to this -- the board continues with employers to not be proactive. They just keep telling employers what it's not. It's a shell game. What it's -- they never say -- if I read through the enter carpenter's brief you can't find where they say what independent judgment is. They keep saying what it's not.

He said, it's exercise personal judgment based on personal experience, training, and abilities. He says, it's the direction of a department and the men under him, the less-skilled people.

Let me go through a few of these points in the record, and these are some questions that were posed by the hearing officer herself in this case. In the record, it's very clear that there typically was oftentimes one individual on duty. There was one question at J.A. 36 where the administrator was asked, even if you're on duty, say, beyond 3:00 and this building supervisor is there, what ends up happening, and would you handle it? He says, no. In other words, if I'm in the building, I would, you know, be surprised if they came to me and said, looks like we're going to be a little short on night shift, what do you think we should do? In other words, the question is going to be asked of the building supervisor, not me, the administrator. She's in charge of that issue. That's as strong a granting of the right to independent judgment and section 211 duties as any."

We can get the production out today with less people, so I won't call anybody in. No, we can't get the production out today, we need to call someone in."

I mean, we'd go back to the opinions of the board, which I agree is just a summary affirmance, so you'd go back to the opinions of the district director and say that's what the words mean, so when they talk about it, you know, when they talk about her super -- how -- unless you want us to go -- you're saying we should go read through the whole record and decide whether all these --"

      "speech": "Your Honor, I'm not saying that you have to go read through the whole record. I'm saying that, absent showing that the Sixth Circuit was in some way arbitrary and capricious about the way in which they handled this matter, they should be affirmed. The other point I would make, and I would like to propose, and I've been doing this work for some 25 years, and not unlike what this Court did in Ellerith & Ferriger, it provided good determinative standards for employers to follow to be able to comply with the law, to define in this situation what is a supervisor, and I'd like to propose six points for this Court that I think address these issues. One is that the individual in question should have the authority from their employer to engage in one of the twelve activities. In our case, they had the authority to assign, transfer, and responsibly direct the employees by those definitions. Two, the individual should be responsible for other employees, a shift, a department, a unit, a facility. In our case, the RN was in charge of the building and the shift, and of the residents, and the facility in general. Senator Flanders talks about that in terms of direction of department, men under him."

The fourth one is the authority they have in exercise under section 211 is different from those they supervise and thus not routine, and I think that addresses the routine issue. It also addresses Yeshiva at 690 about it not being routine, and when you look at the totality of the activities that these RN's are engaged in, they're not routine as compared to the others they supervise. Fifth, that the authority to exercise does not consist only of record-keeping or filing, and thus not clerical, and sixth, in exercising their authority they are not subordinate to those that they supervise, and use their personal judgment based upon experience, training, and ability, thus they use independent judgment, and these standards are rational, they're reasonable, they alleviate any concern that we're trying to suggest that all professionals are supervisors, or that somehow or another --"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, typically isn't it so in hospitals nowadays that you have a lot of subpeople under -- who are not RN's but are LPN's, and then other categories, and that the nurse on the shift would be telling those people -- she wouldn't be the nurse in charge of assigning anybody any place, but she certainly would be directing the nurse's aides and the LPN's."

The only request to introduce further evidence was on the question of whether the employer was exempt from coverage because it was an arm of the State government, or because its board was controlled by public officials. They --"

The board does have a procedure for review of the regional director's findings, and that review was denied in this case, and that is in an order in our appendix to the petition for certiorari, which appears on page 34a, because they found that nothing requiring review had been presented, no substantial issues had been presented. There is a practice of not receiving new evidence in the unfair labor practice proceeding unless there is something newly discovered, or there are special circumstances warranting it, because otherwise the contestants in the representation proceeding would not have sufficient incentive to present all of the relevant evidence and get that proceeding decided accurately."

In respect to that, you say on page 16 of your brief, the building supervisors, namely the nurses here, transfer employees from one unit to another simply, quote, to make sure the head count is there, end quote."

How -- if you're short-staffed, moving it to another unit can't increase the head count.
