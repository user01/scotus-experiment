    "speech": "We'll hear argument now in No. 01-631, the United States v. Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown. Mr. Thompson."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has held in several decisions that the police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and, indeed, vital law enforcement technique. The decision below ignores this Court's teachings as to when a police- citizen encounter on a bus may violate the Fourth Amendment and may constitute the seizure of the passenger. Police-citizen encounters have proven to be effective law enforcement techniques in the area of drug and weapon interdiction. These encounters are also important in today's environment with respect to the protection of passengers in the Nation's public transportation system. This case is controlled by this Court's decision in Bostick and the court below incorrectly applied the Bostick test to these facts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in Bostick the police did inform the passengers that they had a right to refuse consent?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "That is correct, Your Honor, but also in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand to the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court should evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the encounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate. And two of those factors are important here that would put into context what the court below considered. For example, this Court pointed out to the Florida Supreme Court whether or not there were guns pointed and noted that there were no guns pointed in a -- in the Bostick case. This Court also pointed out to the Florida Supreme Court that -- whether or not there was the existence of threatening language, and none of that existed in the case below."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I suppose that the advice that you have a right to decline the request applies -- and I -- I take it you could read Bostick this way; perhaps you disagree -- to whether or not the -- the consent was actually given as opposed to whether there was a coercive environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, and as the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test to be applied is whether or not, under all the circumstances, the police conduct communicated to a reasonable person -- and that presupposes a reasonably -- a reasonable innocent person -- whether or not the passenger could have refused the officer's request to consent or otherwise have terminated the -- terminated the encounter. There is really nothing remarkable about the facts of this case when you look at this Court's decision in Bostick and compare Bostick with this Court's decision in Robinette which clearly pointed --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "My question, Mr. Thompson, was your opening statement was that the Eleventh Circuit had ruled in direct conflict with this Court's precedent. If we're applying a totality of the circumstances test, that's one circumstance that was present there, is not present here. So, whether the Eleventh Circuit erred is for us to determine today, but I do think it's a bit much to say that they -- they just disregarded this Court's precedent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit considered factors that were unlike the factors that this Court in Bostick believed were important in determining whether the police conduct at issue was coercive. And moreover, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly applied the legal principles that this Court formulated with respect to the facts of this case. For example, the Eleventh Circuit noted the importance of Officer Hoover at the front of the bus and pointed out that his presence might lead a -- a passenger to believe that he or she could not leave the bus. Well, this Court in Bostick clearly pointed out that the -- in a -- in the context of a bus interdiction effort, whether or not the passenger could leave the bus was the wrong question. The question was whether or not the passenger -- whether or not the police conduct communicated to the passenger whether or not they could refuse the consent requested or whether or not they could just terminate the questioning of the police officer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it's -- it's true that the -- the issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is -- is not really an issue that -- that focuses the question, and we said so in Bostick. But it doesn't follow from that that it was irrelevant in Bostick or that it's irrelevant here that there was an officer stationed at the front of the bus. If we're going to have a totality of the circumstances test, wouldn't you agree that that is one relevant fact to consider in trying to reconstruct the atmosphere and decide whether or not it signaled to the -- to the person searched the -- the possibility of just ending the encounter?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. That -- it is one relevant fact to be taken into consideration with the other factors, but here the officer stationed at the front of the bus -- at the front of the bus really did not communicate, nor did Officer Lang who was doing the questioning -- did not communicate that -- to any passenger that he or she could not terminate the questioning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He did -- nobody said, you can't leave the bus. But isn't it a fact that a passenger would take into some consideration that there was an officer stationed at the front of the bus?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Your Honor, not in this case. The court below and the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in -- in their findings, if you will, that the -- the aisle was not blocked, the exit was not blocked. In fact, every --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let me -- let me try a -- a different suggestion. The fact that the officer at the front of the bus was kneeling in the driver's seat was one graphic reminder of another fact in this case, and that is, that the driver was gone. The driver had left the bus. The only people exercising any kind of official capacity in that bus were three police officers. One of them was occupying the driver's seat. Isn't that a signal that nobody is going to be going anywhere on this bus? This bus isn't going to be going anywhere until the officers are satisfied. Now, that may or may not be dispositive of anything, but it is a relevant fact on the question of coercion and voluntariness. Isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the presence of the officer at the front of the bus is a factor, but in the context of these facts and if -- in the context of this Court's decision in Delgado where you had armed agents surrounding the factory, and this Court held that simply because the factory workers could not leave without passing those agents --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I agree with you. You're -- you're absolutely right there. The -- the point that I'm making is that you can't go through this kind of analysis and say, well, this fact is irrelevant. This shouldn't have been considered by the court. That fact was irrelevant. That shouldn't have been considered. It was a relevant fact. What it all adds up to, as you suggest by the Delgado reference, is a different question, but it's a relevant fact, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "It's a relevant fact, but the factors to be considered and the factors that this Court clearly announced in -- in the Bostick case were factors that were threatening, factors that were otherwise coercive, like pointing a gun. In this particular case, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit even noted that there was no evidence that any of the passengers saw that this officer was armed. The officers were --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Thompson, did they know that he was an officer? Was it clear that he was an officer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "The officer was conducting individual passenger-specific questioning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The -- the other two officers were I know, but was there -- was it clear that the person kneeling in the driver's seat was an officer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "He was casually dressed, Your Honor, and it's not clear from the record as to whether or not he was a police officer."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did he have his badge? The other two showed their badges. Did the one in the front show --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "I don't believe the record is clear as to where the badge was located with respect to the officer at the front of the bus."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did he enter with the other two?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Yes. They all entered as passengers, all casually dressed. And with respect to the conduct of this -- of this search --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I mean, I -- what -- I don't know what that -- why should that make a difference. If somebody shows me a badge and he's casually dressed, I know he's got a gun, or he's going to be fired. An officer is fired if he doesn't carry his gun. Everybody knows that. Let me -- let me ask you this. Would it be appropriate in your view for this Court to write an opinion in which we say that citizens have certain obligations to know their rights and to assert their rights? That's what makes for a strong democracy. The law lives in the consciousness of the people. And people have a certain obligation to assert their rights. If they don't want to be searched, they say I don't want to be searched. Should we write that in an opinion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Well, that follows on with the -- the clear test that this Court announced in Bostick, and the test was, Your Honor, whether or not the police conduct commuted anything -- communicated anything to the citizens and these passengers as to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What about the proposition as I -- as I've stated it? Because if you say yes -- and I think there's a good answer for it -- then I'd just say, well, we have to distinguish Miranda at least. Miranda is based on a contrary assumption. That's what's running through my mind as I'm asking the question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Well, here -- here the -- the citizens -- some citizens did refuse Officer Lang's request, and what -- what you posit is -- is really the guts of what is going on here. As Officer Lang testified, Your Honor, many of the citizens -- most citizens went along with the police questioning in -- in this particular -- these particular bus interdictions, and they -- and they were happy to do so. Officer Lang testified that many of the bus passengers appreciated his efforts in coming onto the bus. They -- it made them feel a sense of -- of safety. And here citizens generally do know their rights, and here the police did not communicate anything to these passengers that would indicate that they had to answer, that they were required or otherwise compelled to answer Officer Lang's questions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did any other case that we considered involve a body pat-down, not just a request to look at luggage? This -- in this case the -- the luggage didn't turn up anything of interest to the police, but the pat- down did. And the image of let's take what is -- Mr. Drayton is sitting next to a man who has just been hauled off the bus, handcuffed. I imagine he would feel some intimidation at that point when the police then turned to him and said, okay, we'd like to search you too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Well, the -- the Bostick test presupposes a reasonable, innocent person. In this particular case, Mr. -- Mr. Brown's consent was unambiguous. He opened his coat. He -- in response to the question, he said, sure. He opened his coat. He took out a cell phone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But Drayton said nothing throughout the whole encounter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Drayton's -- Drayton's consent, as the district court found, was clear and unambiguous. He raised his hands off of his thighs, Your Honor. There was nothing that Officer Lang said to Mr. -- or said to Mr. Drayton or had said to Mr. Brown that would have indicated that Mr. Drayton could not have terminated the questioning or that he could have refused consent. And as this Court noted -- as this Court noted in Bostick, the fact that a lawbreaker knows that the search is going to uncover contraband or is -- knows that the search is going to uncover drugs does not make the consent involuntary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it doesn't make it involuntary, but it -- it does suggest perhaps that there is an ambiguity here as -- as against your claim that there was none in Brown's consent because -- and correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I -- I think the first request to Brown was -- or maybe to the two of them together -- can I look at your -- your luggage, your bag, whatever they had pointed to, and they said, sure. And I presume they said sure because they knew there was nothing in it that was going to be incriminating. So, the officer looked in the -- in the luggage and he found nothing. Then he turned to Brown and said, mind if I do a pat-down, or whatever the phrase was. Well, that's the search that's in question here, and I would have thought that at that point Brown was in the situation in which the reasonable citizen would have thought I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't. If he pats me down and he's -- he's thorough about it, he's going to find the -- the drugs. If I say you can't pat me down, having just given permission to him to -- to look in the -- in the bag, he's going to know that there must be something on me that wasn't on the bag. And -- and, therefore, it seems to me that the -- that Brown at that point was by no means in a position in which he had a kind of free choice to say yes or no. So, it sounds to me as though it is ambiguous. Have I got the facts wrong?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "You have the facts, but your conclusion, Your Honor, I would differ with because in -- in the situation both individuals pointed to the bag. There was nothing in Officer Lang's request to Mr. Brown that would -- that would -- that -- that would send or communicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have refused the request. There was nothing in Officer Lang's question that would indicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have otherwise terminated the questioning. Why some of the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you don't agree, I hope, with the -- with the proposition that there would be no reason to decline the pat-down search except the reason that he had something incriminating on him. I mean, the mere fact that you've -- you've acceded to the luggage search, which is a much less intrusive search, does not show that -- that you have something to hide when you -- when you decline to -- to have a pat-down. Don't -- don't you agree that a consent to a luggage search is a lot less difficult to obtain than consent to a pat-down?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "The nature -- the nature of the search is not necessary to the Bostick inquiry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I think you're -- I think you're missing my point. Justice Souter was suggesting that having acceded to the luggage search, the only plausible reason for objecting to the pat-down would be that I have something on me that is incriminating. And I -- I acceded to the luggage search because I knew there was nothing incriminating. But don't you think that an innocent citizen could agree to a -- a policeman's search of luggage but not agree to a pat-down?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Your Honor."

    "speech": "You know, let's be reasonable here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes. But don't -- don't you think the most probable inference is the inference I gave you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. You have -- again, you have to understand this Court's holding in Bostick and that is the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The holding in Bostick, if I remember it, was that the Florida Supreme Court was wrong in adopting a per se rule and left open the question of whether there was a seizure in that case. Isn't that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. But in this particular case, the reasonable person, as this Court said, presupposes a reasonable, innocent person. Lawbreakers sometimes agree to be -- agree to be searched, knowing that the drugs are in their luggage or on their person, for a number of reasons, sometimes as -- as these gentlemen did. They want to be cooperative. They do not want to send some kind of message that they indeed have the items in question. They want to appear innocent. They do this for any number of reasons, hoping that the police officer will not search them and go away."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Thompson, you --"

    "speaker": "THOMPSON",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- you were about to say --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "-- compulsion. Excuse me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- that the police -- you were about to say when the police go over the line. I think you said here they did nothing that would imply that consent or that -- that the search was required of the citizen. What -- can -- can you give a description of when the police would step over the line? Is it -- must the police give words of command, get up, I want to search you? Is that -- does it take that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "The -- if -- if the police would communicate to the citizen somehow that the citizen's response was compelled. For example, in -- in Bostick this Court noted that pointing guns, drawn guns would lead to that -- that kind of compulsion or coercion. For example, if the police used threatening language. If the police communicated to the reasonable person that he or she could not refuse the request for consent or could not otherwise terminate the questioning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that explains Miranda, of course, to the extent anything explains it. (Laughter.)"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "Absolutely. Here you have unstructured, rapidly developing police-citizen encounters, and what is important here --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And you have a request and a response. And the response is that there is no objection to the search. And it seems to me that that is an objective consideration of the highest importance."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "This is a seizure case, Your Honor. That's the -- the court below decided this case under the -- under the Bostick test. Both parties before the Eleventh Circuit urged the Bostick test, and this is -- I would submit that this is a seizure case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you think it always would follow if you concluded that there was no seizure, that there was necessarily voluntary consent to the search?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "It -- in this Court's test in Bostick, the Court merged the voluntary issue and the voluntariness in with the -- in with the Bostick seizure analysis. So, I would say that -- that the two are merged together and are related."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It doesn't seem to me that analytically they have to be. It seems to me you could have a case in which you could -- the officer could say to the man, you're perfectly free to get off the bus anytime you want to, but I'd like to -- to search you first, and may I do so? And then the question would be whether the search was voluntary even if there had been no seizure. It seems to me that could be a scenario that would make sense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "It's -- it's hard to -- in the context of these bus -- police-citizen encounters on a bus, it's hard to really see the distinction between the voluntariness test and the seizure test."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it does seem to me the passenger might have two different thoughts. One, I better not get off the bus. I want to get to Columbus or Cleveland or wherever we're going. So, I -- that -- maybe I can get off the bus, but it just doesn't make any sense. But that's one inquiry. The second inquiry is, do I want to let this fellow search me? It seems to me they are really two separate questions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "I don't know, Your Honor, but I -- I would posit here that we do not really need in this particular case to -- to understand the full extent of the scope of the voluntariness test because the court below clearly decided this case under Bostick and as a seizure case."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If we were writing on a blank slate and other cases weren't there, what would be the Department's objections to a rule of law that said when you're on a bus, only 11 inches of an aisle, three people get on. One is sitting in the back looking over the crowd. The other two systematically work their way to the front. What would be the objection to saying, policeman, of course, you can ask citizens to cooperate? Certainly that's a very desirable thing. But in those closed, cramped quarters where you have three, just say you don't have to answer if you don't want to. You don't have to be searched if you don't want to, making clear that you're eliciting voluntary cooperation and nobody is under compulsion. What would be the objection to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",
    "speech": "I can think of three reasons. Your Honor, this Court has consistently held that we -- you do not want to saddle law enforcement officers with some kind of bright line test in Fourth Amendment cases. That's very important here when I would submit that Bostick is an appropriate vehicle to determine the validity of consent. In these particular cases, it's -- it's very difficult. You have an unstructured, rapidly evolving and developing situation, and warnings would not be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And one of the difficulties with -- with a warning is, you know, Miranda was supposed to be a bright line test where, you know, we didn't have to argue about anything. Well, we had at least 60 or 70 cases here deciding whether somebody introduced -- was interrogating and that sort of thing. So, if you have some sort of a requirement like that, it's just another layer of litigation."

Is that relevant at all?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "THOMPSON",

  {
    "speaker": "SPIVEY",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reaffirm Bostick in its entirety. We are not arguing that advice should be required. Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely right with the language that advice is a factor particularly worth noting. If Bostick is revised, we would ask the Court to remand to the court of appeals, as it did in Bostick, so that it can reconsider. I believe the key to this test -- and I don't mean to sound presumptuous. Having thought long and hard, I think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was trying to give voice to the seizure or -- and the consent test, as set out in Bostick. In Bostick at U.S. 437, the Court wrote -- it focused on what the police conduct -- conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person. And in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395, what the Eleventh Circuit focused on -- it said, it is enough that the circumstances themselves would indicate that the search can proceed only if consent is given. So, I believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's use of the word -- that focused on what does it communicate with their use of the word indicate. And indicate necessarily refers back to -- it expressly refers back to the circumstances, which is the totality. And while courts tend to focus most commonly on whether or not advice was given or not given, I think there are any number of acts or omissions that focus on the police conduct --"

And at Mr. Souter's direction, I will lodge them with the Clerk after argument. They are: the McLean case, which is case number 01-10678, dated July 6th, 2001, after Washington; the Reese case, 00-11291, dated March 15th, 2001; and the Garrett case, dated -- case number 97-2202, dated November 19th, 1997."

But my point was simply that if they had -- if they had a de facto per se rule, then it would be outcome -- the presence or absence of rights would be outcome -- outcome-determinative in every case. But in those three cases, which were on-bus searches, there was either no advice or no mention of it in the opinion. And of course, these unpublished opinions are very hard to get, but the Government gave me an incentive to find them."

    "speech": "The -- the briefs make a big deal about the fact that they didn't announce that everybody on the bus first -- a general announcement what was going to happen. I -- I -- it seems to me that if we go down that road and it'd be like our cases, where one case says they didn't look at the officer, and the next case said they didn't look at the -- I -- I just think that's equivocal. I think you can argue that either way. And you go on for 15 pages in -- in your brief about the -- the police chose the -- the locus, the bus locus, the fact that they were close to the passengers, which they obviously had to be in the bus, and -- and talked individually to each passenger, the officer's appearance and demeanor, they constructively blocked the aisle, they presented their badges, but they didn't show the gun. It -- it seems to me this world you're creating for us is -- is not strong for the Constitution. It seems to me a strong world is when officers respect people's rights and -- and people know what their rights are and -- and assert their rights. I don't want to be searched."

    "speech": "I agree that would be an ideal world if all our citizens took civics or took law and knew their rights, but I don't believe they do. And I think the fact that we go through the factors is simply a product of the totality test. That's necessary to look at all the relevant factors in that totality test. But I don't think there is any defining point at which one -- a person can say I think it's up to the court in every case, is this too coercive, does it go too far? I would note that in Bostick, Bostick did -- did set out the seizure test at 437, the consent test at 438. The one thing it really in my mind didn't really clearly focus on was the test that the Eleventh Circuit was looking at. The question they looked at is whether the circumstances here were so coercive that no reasonable person could have given a consent that would have been determined to be voluntary. And I think that's why in the court's opinion, the court of appeals opinion -- this is -- excuse me -- footnote 4 at page 6a of the petition to the appendix. That is why they then used the language -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's footnote 6 at page 8a. They then used the language, quoting Bostick, but whether a reasonable person would have felt free to decline the officer's request. And I think that is -- was their attempt to go to the element of was this -- was this a coercive environment. It distinguishes it from the seizure test which focuses on the police conduct and what it would have communicated and I -- and then the consent test, which is at 438, which focuses -- under Schneckloth includes a focus on the personal factors, factors personal to the defendant. And I think that's why the Court here said that those factors personal to the defendant were not determinative because we're looking at a little higher level of analysis as to whether this environment was so coercive. I do agree that in the context of your average bus case, it's a very short encounter, very brief. The testimony was that in 15 to 20 minutes, the officer could engage with two to three people. So, you're looking maybe 5 to 10 minutes per person. And I think that the test -- that the factors relating to seizure and the factors relating to the -- the consent tend to be conflated, and so it is sometimes sort of hard to sort out. And a lot of the factors will apply to both of those tests."

But if he comes up and says, do you mind if I search your person, you know, I don't care what other -- there's a policeman in the front of the bus. Who cares? He -- he has made it very clear that he's asking for your permission. What -- what more need he do than that? Do you mind if I search your person?"

I mean, it seemed that was almost the question that I -- I asked when -- when you were responding to Justice Stevens and you said, well, ultimately sure, anybody who gets these warnings, with a teaspoonful of brains, is going to say no, I -- I'm not going to let you search. And -- and it seemed to me that maybe the -- the answer to the problem is there are some situations in which if you don't give the warning, it does get to the point of -- or is virtually a -- a coercive situation per se, and it may be that there's no easy answer in those circumstances. If you don't let them know that they have a right to refuse, there's inherent coercion. If you do let them know, most people are going to say, no, you can't search. But you resist that. You -- you don't regard it as inherently coercive. And I -- I guess I'm not sure why you -- you resist it. Why isn't it?"
