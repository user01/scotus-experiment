Wurie, I think, illustrate why any categorical rule that would preclude searches of cell phones incident to arrest would be inconsistent with historical practice and detrimental to law enforcement. This is a case where what the officers did was see a phone ringing. On the outside screen, the caller was identified as \"my house.\" The officers opened up the phone, pressed one button to see that the call came in from \"my house\" and pressed another to see what the phone number was. That's all they did. That kind of a search serves valid, time­honored functions in the search situation of helping to ascertain the identity of the offender. This was a crucial fact because a few minutes later, Wurie lied about where he lived, which was relevant to the police ultimately obtaining a warrant to search his house. They didn't know where he was. They would not be able to ­­"

But in all of the other cases that you could imagine that involve searches for evidence, letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds, which have been discussed here, once the officer has it, you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in it because that could be done under a warrant. There's no time constraint. There's no destruction of evidence constraint. Here, in fact, there actually is a destruction­of­evidence threat with respect to the general category of cell phones, and that's what this Court has been asked to look at, the general category, cell phones and smartphones. We discussed earlier the threat of remote wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter to that. There is the other threat that I think is even more critical to law enforcement today, and that is encryption. Because if the phone turns off and becomes encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if they can break through the encryption and actually obtain the evidence. So to the extent that the traditional destruction­of­evidence rationale justified the search of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional items, it applies even more strongly with respect to cell phones than it does with most of the items that might be seized from a person. So Wurie, I think ­­"

The key is often stored in memory and it's accessible only when you can get into the phone. Now, if the phone is on and functioning because the person has been arrested while they are, for example, making a phone call, you can get access to the phone and you can attempt to get information from the phone without the encryption key being an obstacle.

So it's a very common thing for officers to take advantage of the information that's on a phone just the way that they would take advantage of the information that's on a person to find out who they are dealing with. And I think it was asked in the Riley argument whether there were instances in which phones have been used to trigger dangers. And there are instances in which people have used their cell phones right before an arrest to call in a posse of their accomplices to basically attack the police. And by looking at the cell phone quickly, if it's available to the ­­ to the officers, they can look quickly and see if there was a text sent in the last five minutes or a phone call that might actually protect their safety, which is another one of the traditional justifications of search incident to arrest.

      "speaker": "DREEBEN",
      "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I would not be able to answer a question about what condition most cell phones are found in. The fact that this issue has arisen repeatedly in cases across the country indicates that at least in a significant number of cases, the phones are not locked and the officers are able to obtain access to the information. Now, if they are not able to obtain access to the information, I want to tie this back to things that could give the Court some comfort if the Court were concerned about the possibility for police searching too much evidence in cell phones that's not relevant to the crime for which the person is arrested or his identity. Now, we talked earlier about the crime of arrest limitation, which I think would screen out a great many, not all, minor crimes. The Court has, at least in the Welsh v. Wisconsin case, talking about exigent circumstances justifying an entry into the home, distinguished between serious and minor crimes. That's another possible line that the Court could explore. I'm not as much in favor of that one because I do think that the officers have an interest in determining, no matter who they have arrested, who that person is, because the person could pose an unknown threat even if they are stopped only for a traffic violation. Ascertaining their identity through their cell phone is a useful way to do that. There are also potential duration limits on a search­incident­to­arrest. As its name indicates, it's incident to the arrest, and this Court's decisions have described the lowering or reduction of expectation of privacy of an arrestee as occurring for a reasonable time and to a reasonable extent after the arrest, then other Fourth Amendment doctrines kick in. So to the extent that most of these searches are going to occur either at the scene of the arrest ­­"

      "speech": "Okay. Well, that ­ that is my last potential limiting principle. This Court need not consider in this case the consequences of downloading the entire contents of a cellphone to a UFED, a universal forensic extraction device which the briefs have talked about. That didn't happen in either of these cases. These cases involve manual searches of the information that's available to the user of the phone. Once the information has been captured into an electronic database separately in an extraction device, there is at least an argument that at that point the evidence is preserved and potentially the warrant requirement would have a different application, at least if the search of that forensic database was going to go beyond ascertaining identity and verifying officer safety considerations. The Court does not need to examine that in this case. It may well be that expectations of privacy do not exist as to information that the user himself can quickly access on a phone, the kind of thing the police are likely to look at when they make an arrest because they are interested in developing evidence that relates to the crime, protecting their safety and ascertaining identity. They are not really interested in going through all an arrestee's medical records and photographs and so forth."

You want to take the phone off the network to avoid the remote wiping problem, to avoid corruption of data through new data coming in. It's sound forensic practice to do that and it also serves what we think is a limiting principle. Again, the Court doesn't have to decide that limiting principle in this case. There's no claim that any cloud data was accessed in this case. We're only saying that the search­incident­to­arrest doctrine serves a valuable function, serves a particularly valuable function with cellphones, because they are so commonly used as the medium of the commission of crimes.

And so that's what the arresting officer was looking for. It's no different than what he would have looked for on the arrestee's person in his wallet. So it wasn't the kind of cloud­based search, search into health records. It was a scope­focused search. So I think that there are limiting principles, Justice Kennedy, that you referred to. One is when the officer is looking for crime of arrest­related material and there is evidence that can be plausibly said is crime of arrest­related material on the phone, he can look for that. The Court could couple that, if it wasn't satisfied that that was a sufficient limitation, with a scope­based limit which would say that you can't look everywhere on the phone where there's no realistic chance that there's going to be evidence related to the crime of arrest. You can't just rove through the phone. You need to keep a scope focus. And that can be enforced and would be enforced by defendants, I can assure you, through post hoc litigation and suppression. And the police would have to conform their conduct to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment in conducting the search."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",
      "speech": "It's very hard to see how that limit would be applied. You can see and the police would be able to articulate why almost every application, every entry in a cellphone would reasonably be anticipated to have evidence of a particular crime. Obviously e­mails, obviously call logs. Even, you know, Facebook. I mean, if it's a weapons crime, maybe they've got pictures of themselves with guns.

What Petitioner did not do was provide similar information for the 500 or so other phones that are on the market and that will be on the market in the coming years so that police officers will be equipped with a manual that will probably be as thick as the New York City telephone book with the various procedures that are needed to prevent any phone from going into an encryption mode and becoming inaccessible. They don't know that at the time they seize the phone, Justice Breyer, and that's why exigent circumstances, unless it's done as a categorical rule, because I did not know whether this phone would encrypt, I searched it, unless you do that, then you are basically putting the officers at the mercy of technology, which will increasingly be able to defeat their ability to conduct the kind of routine searches that they have always conducted in the past."

And if the Court does have concerns, as many members of the Court have expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and compromise positions. This case, I think, as California pointed out, both this case and Riley, don't really involve totally unpacking somebody's life from their smartphone. And I'm not suggesting that the Court should resolve these cases by announcing a rule that's just limited to the facts of the cases.

And there is nothing ­­ a seize­and­secure rule protects both the individuals' expectations of privacy and security and the government's right to obtain evidence consonant with the protections of the warrant requirement, giving the neutral magistrate an opportunity to determine whether there's probable cause for the search of the cell phone and to define the limits of that search."

This Court has created language in its jurisprudence that prefers warrants in certain circumstances, but as the Court recognized in McNealey last term and in Maryland v. King, the search incident to arrest doctrine is a categorical exception and this case illustrates why. The information that was found on the phone was very time sensitive and important to law enforcement. It helped fulfill the typical purposes, the categorical purposes of the search incident to arrest doctrine. It helped verify identity, it helped solve the crime that ­­ for which the individual was arrested, and it was done in a reasonable and nonintrusive manner. There was nothing about this search that exposed reams of private data to view. To the extent that the data was not in a call log really subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy at all, it was discovered in a search but I think that underscores why the search was limited and reasonable. So this case really, I think, exemplifies why a categorical rule that respondent urges in this case would not be appropriate, and we submit that this Court should reverse the Court of Appeals.
