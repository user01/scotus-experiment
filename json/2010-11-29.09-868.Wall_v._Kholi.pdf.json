Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue before the Court today is whether a State court sentence reduction motion which is a pure plea for leniency qualifies as, quote, \"an application for post-conviction or other collateral review\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2). The State respectfully argued there are at least three reasons why such a term as \"collateral review\" refers only to a legal challenge, refers to those recognized post-direct appeal applications in which constitutional, jurisdictional, and other such fundamental errors may be raised. First, as this Court has said, it is presumed -- Congress is presumed to have known the language that this Court used in its decisions, and the term \"collateral review\" has been used by this Court, certainly when referring to Federal 2255 applications, as those type of independent civil inquiries testing the validity of a conviction and/or sentence -­"

They're going to -- it's either going to be a motion for sentence leniency or it's going to be a motion to correct an illegal sentence. These matters -- and they have to be pled by the State as well. So when an applicant goes to Federal court, district court, and files a 2254, if we want to raise the affirmative defense of the time bar, which will save the Federal court a lot of time, obviously, because there is no case at all -- and if we can contrast it with exhaustion, for example, which, as this Court obviously is familiar with, presents very complicated questions of whether, you know, State procedures were exhausted and claims were exhausted, this is very straightforward. If somebody raises a motion which challenges the legality of the sentence, it will be characterized in State court in the run of the mine -- in the run of the mine cases, as an illegal sentence."

Many States, including Rhode Island, have postconviction review statutes. So Congress wanted to have that time, the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were pending tolled. But not every State uses that phrase. Not every State uses that term.

Indeed, a 2255, while it may be separately filed, is then consolidated with the original proceeding, and there's an entry in the docket -- you shall not file any more pleadings in that separate case.
