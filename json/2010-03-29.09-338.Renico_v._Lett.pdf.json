  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because this is a habeas case arising from a murder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the threshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the Michigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied in rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had abused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due to deadlock. The Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas, ignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad discretion, due the trial court determination. Here there was a note suggesting acrimonious deliberations received early on in the second day of deliberations, followed by a second note suggesting a deadlock after approximately 10 hours of trial testimony and 4 hours of deliberations. The trial court at that time engaged the foreperson in a colloquy, a two-part colloquy, in which the foreperson not only confirmed the content of the first note, but also confirmed the existence of a deadlock."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "Going back to this Court's opinion in Perez, considering sound judgment, discretion, considering all the circumstances, here we have to look at the totality of the circumstances in that it was a relatively short trial, that we have a note that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious deliberations, the second note that could be reasonably construed as a deadlock. And then the trial court did not declare a mistrial at that point. Rather, the trial court brings the jury out and engages in a colloquy. And in that colloquy, the trial court accepts the foreperson's answer at her word. And that is: \"Are you going to be able to reach unanimous verdict?\" The answer being: \"No.\" And in fact, it's the Sixth Circuit who second-guessed in this case by saying: You can't place that much weight on that statement by the foreperson."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. And this Court has qualified that as broad discretion and special respect due the trial court determination, after the trial court is the one viewing the jury in real time. So absolutely. And in fact, this -- this risk of coercion was recognized also by this Court in Arizona v. Washington."

After the foreperson said: No, Judge, we are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge says: All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury is dismissed. And then the next entry in the transcript that we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we could set a new trial date. Now, Mr. Gordon was defense -- was the defense attorney?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE ALITO",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "No. No, there wasn't. But, you know, the colloquy is relatively short. But no, I believe the defendant's counsel could have objected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, there was a ruling by the court: I hereby declare a mistrial. I suppose you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the jury was present when the judge said: I hereby declare the mistrial."

  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",

    "speaker": "JUSTICE GINSBURG",

    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "In Michigan confessions of error are controlled by court rule as a procedural matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to accept statements that could be qualified as a confession of error or not. Here the Michigan Supreme Court addressed this case on the merits, the underlying double jeopardy merits. In much the same way, it did not address potential waiver or consent issues by the defendant. So we have a merits opinion here."

  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "There are thousands and thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are not all that unusual. So in this case we have testimony going on for 4 days, 10 hours total. And we have jury deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the jury was deadlocked. There are some things for, some against, only a couple. And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all right. Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases that must be there over the decades, you probably looked through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar members. How many have you found where you would say that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on your side? In other words, there are going to be millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of them will support the defense. Maybe many support you. But I haven't seen any here that say they support you. So how many do? And what do you want me to read to see that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse of the judge's discretion? How many did you find which will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the norm?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "Well, the difficult part in answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUSTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "Correct. That's why I am asking the question. What they've said is, is it an abuse of discretion? And they've also said the judge has to be careful. Okay, so we have like an abuse of discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the abuse of discretion side. I think anyone would admit. But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, not quite an abuse of discretion? Or is this the most extreme case in history?"

That's what they said. Then they asked to see the evidence and they said: Explain Count 2. Then they said: Are we allowed to break? And then they said: What if we can't agree? Mistrial, retrial, what? And at 12:27, the same time, they said: What about lunch? Then he brought them out and he says to the juror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly deadlocked? And the foreperson said: The majority of us don't believe that. And he said: Don't say what you're going to say. And then he doesn't have the carried that burden. But we will ask when they come up. It is their burden, however."

    "speech": "Could you -- yes, but that doesn't mean none. What -- other than we have cases where judges have declared mistrials because they are going on vacation. Those are easy, okay? But somewhere the word \"abuse of discretion\" means that someone has discretion, but is improperly exercising it. What facts would it take for you to believe that that would have been the case? What do you have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -­ that would have been an abuse of discretion? What point? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that would be enough, right? Or would it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "Well, to best answer Your Honor's question, I would point out again that in Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned are when the trial court acts irrationally, irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons. And in our yellow brief we cited several cases where I would say the Court was correct to find an abuse of discretion -­ the Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary indication. The jury in the Starling case indicated that, we are making progress and in fact can we have 15 more minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares a mistrial. Your Honor's example then with the Gordy case would be the imminent travel plans and docket considerations. We also have where the court acts sua sponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the trial court -­"

    "speech": "Why isn't that this one, meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict. It asks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or not as a group they believe they are hopelessly deadlocked. Why isn't this precipitous action?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORMLEY",
    "speech": "Well, again, as I -- as I mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that it is indicative of acrimony. It's a reasonable view of the second note that it was indicative of a deadlock."

So again, here, what is paramount is that it's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively unreasonably apply this Court's clearly established precedent. There -- there is no case that flatly controls this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard. In fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own three-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when they said that there are three considerations that determine. So when you take that three-part test, which is not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well as the second-guessing of those predicate factual determinations being, well, the jury probably didn't have enough time to even review the witnesses, juries often report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as much weight to this foreperson's statement, it's contrary to these dual layers of deference. And if there are no further questions, may I reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?"

I do disagree with my friend's contention that the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test. What the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some considerations or some guidelines, including the first of which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions of the parties.
