      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court: This is a decidedly local tort action which defendant respectfully submits does not invoke a federal uniformity interest; certainly it does not invoke a need for such interest so compelling as to require this Court to create or infer a wrongful death cause of action based on general negligence under circumstances where there is no claim of vessel liability. What this case is not is a case which would involve any concept endemic to or originating in or peculiar to the sea. We are not concerned about seamen's responses; we are not concerned about unseaworthiness or any form of vessel liability."

    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "In Kermarec, Your Honor, which involved negligence, the negligence was negligence in the operation of a vessel, either with it navigating or the manner in which it was operated, but nothing like our case where we have a local enterprise that was operating a crane that was located on a pier over a --"
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I believe it did, but again, that was a case of a visitor on a vessel, and the captain of the vessel had an obligation to make sure that the stairway was in good condition, etcetera, but there you're dealing with a concept which I think to be very akin to that in Moragne. What we're dealing with there is a concept of the manner in which a vessel is operated, a vessel is maintained for the safety of people on it, and that is the kind of concept which requires uniform treatment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But Moragne dealt with -- by its terms at any rate -- with unseaworthiness, and the question you've presented here is whether Moragne is a basis for also extending that doctrine to negligence as well as unseaworthiness, and yet in Kermarec it seems that we've already recognized a general maritime claim for negligence. You feel this is different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, I think what we have to do is look at the concept of uniformity in the context of Article 3, Section 2 in the Federalist Papers, and think in terms of why is it that this particular body of law, as of all bodies of law there are -- this substantive body of admiralty is given to this Court and to Congress, and the purpose is so that the nation speaks with one voice under circumstances where there can be an impact on our relationship with our partners in trade."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, Mr. Ferrini, the question which we granted certiorari, I thought, was whether a general maritime law cause of action for wrongful death in negligence exists or should exist. In other words, whether Moragne should extend to wrongful death action based on negligence, and I didn't -- have you raised below the question of even if it does -- even if the answer is yes, it should, it shouldn't apply here because these are all land-based actors. I mean, I would have thought that would be a logical defense to raise, but I don't see that as part of the question."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Suppose I say yes, Moragne extends to wrongful death based on negligence, but does it extend to totally land-based action like this? You didn't raise that apparently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Your fourth circuit, Your Honor, quite frankly, the focus of the court and the parties was upon what does Moragne create rather than should it create an exception."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, answer my question. Suppose I say yes, Moragne, sure it extends to that. We've been saying that all along in dicta, at least. Suppose I say yes. Is that open then to make your argument that whatever Moragne extends to, it doesn't apply to totally land-based actors like these? Is that open?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "I think it's certainly open, Your Honor, because when we -- when you made your decision in Moragne, the idea was not just is there a general cause of action for all circumstances for wrongful death? No, the focus was on unseaworthiness and on maritime duties. And by the same token, if you're going to here decide if there is a wrongful death action created under the Moragne rationale, if that much of Moragne is even left existent, certainly I think this Court has the jurisdiction to determine under what circumstances, and just as --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I just didn't think you raised that here. I mean -- and we ended up with this very limited question about whether Moragne, to the extend it applies at all, extends to wrongful death actions based on negligence. But these other questions I didn't think were presented to us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Your Honor, with all due respect, I view our question as having been raised as whether there is a wrongful death cause of action under the circumstances with which the Court is presented."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you're arguing -- the limitation, it seems to me -- death wouldn't matter. It would be just as land-locked if it had been mere injury, and that's the question I'd like you to answer under the law as you see it. Suppose Mr. Garris had not been killed, he'd just been badly injured. Would he have an action under Federal maritime law for negligence?"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "In that respect I am, Your Honor, because this Court has created a general maritime body of law dealing with injury. There is no two ways about that. But the result would be different because that -- the fact that the state law does not give the same remedy that that general body of law gives is not an objective of uniformity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But all of your -- your discussion about state domain versus admiralty, maritime -- it seems to fall apart when one recognizes that it can be the very same accident. It's maritime if he's merely injured, but no maritime responsibility if he's killed. And that seems to be a hard line to explain to anyone, at least who's not a lawyer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Well, maritime law has been described as one of the most complex areas, and it certainly is a patchwork, and that is the historical consequence of the way things developed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But you were giving something beyond historical patchwork -- you were giving some kind of rationale distinction between land-locked, sea duty, Federal/state -- and I could accept all that were it not for that the distinction is only death versus injury."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Well, I respectfully submit that to create a monistic single area of law covering both death and injury, the first thing this Court would have to do is overrule the Tungus. It would have to overrule --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Why? Tungus just said you can take the state wrongful death claim. Doesn't -- well, let's take Yamaha, where we, this Court recognized that you could have a claim under the state wrongful death act. It took that position even on the assumption -- and it was only an assumption in that case -- that you could also have a claim under Moragne."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Yes, this Court did not decide, however. In footnote 7 we said -- this Court said we are not deciding that there is such a cause of action, but I take it a step further. What this Court, I believe, was assuming was the existence of a cause of action against the manufacturer of a vessel, because that is what a jet ski has been determined to be. And it comes back to my same concept of what is the purpose of uniformity? And I don't think the purpose of uniformity is that all remedies be the same in all circumstances, because that's exactly what Your Honor said was not the objective of uniformity in the Yamaha case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But that was a case where you could have both State and Federal remedies if there was a Federal remedy, and we said if there was a Federal remedy, that wouldn't preclude also having a state remedy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "I think it is very -- I think what Your Honor is driving at is the possibility of concurrent existence of a Federal cause of action and a state cause of action."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "And I point out -- I hasten to point out that that is the one thing my opponent has not raised or urged, and why is that? Because I do not believe that that is consistent with uniformity. If uniformity -- the purpose of uniformity is going to be that there is some semblance of reliability in knowing what cause of action is going to exist, once you create a dual system, then everything is up in the air -- your insurance questions, your rates, everything is up in the air, because we don't know in any individual death what law the plaintiff is going to invoke."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So then your answer must be in the case of injury it's only maritime law -- it's only Federal law, not state law."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "I think that that is -- in the case of injury, absolutely. I agree with that. There is this existing body of law, and I don't think, however that that -- that the fact that that is a solitary body of law is a matter of uniformity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But regardless of whether it's a matter of uniformity or not, if the Federal maritime law covers it in the case of injury, what is the justification for a separate regime in the case of death?"

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "I mean, I think you -- I think maybe I misunderstood your answer to several questions, but going back to the Chief Justice's question about Kermarec, I understood you to assume that yes, there is a general maritime cause of action for negligence."

      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Yes."
    },

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "And I understood you to have said later on in the argument that if this individual had merely been injured but had not been killed, that that cause of action would apply. And if that's the case, the question for us I think is why should we have a separate regime when the negligence is efficient enough to cause his death?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "First, I would like to correct an answer I gave earlier to the Chief Justice. I forgot -- I believe Kermarec was an injury case and not a death case, a totally different situation."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, before we get to uniformity, what about irrationality? If we're going to recognize the cause of action for the injured, why are we not going to recognize the cause of action when death ensues?"
    },

      "speaker": "FERRINI",

    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You do agree with Moragne? Well, I really can't say why, having decided Moragne, we want to draw the line between -- if indeed we didn't already cross that bridge in Moragne -- I don't know why we would want to draw a distinction between injury and death."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Because this Court has recognized time and time again that you must treat everybody the same, no matter where they are on the sea. And when you're dealing with unseaworthiness, that vessel had better be operational regardless of whether it's in territorial waters or in the Sea of Japan or next door, because everybody has -- let's put it this way, I think uniformity -- the concept of uniformity is very similar to the concept of the diversity of citizenship, which the purpose of which is fair treatment of foreigners. And regardless if you're dealing with a seaman who gets in, in Italy and he comes over here and he's injured over here, he has to be treated the same. But when you're dealing in a case like this with a harbor worker, and you're dealing with local businesses like my client that's named after Norfolk, and it's in the -- there would have been no, talk about abnormalities or, there would be no recovery. We wouldn't even be here if this particular crane had struck him while he was doing preparatory work on the dock. Never -- not -- there is no such thing as perfect symmetry; you'll never reach that because --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Because I think what Your Honor is looking at is the particular jurisdiction. If this had happened in New York Harbor where the law is different, there would be a substantial recovery. But the fourth circuit got it wrong when the fourth circuit said that it's happenstance that the man was killed in Norfolk Harbor rather than New York Harbor. He was in Norfolk Harbor because that's where he lived and that's where he worked, and that's where he died. And the state should be able to provide for their interest in deciding the familial issues of wrongful death, who should recover, and how much they should recover. It should be able to decide that what a statutory employer will get as a quid pro quo for giving the benefits. And I would point out there is a very little difference between the LHWCA and the Virginia wrongful death statute. Both of them have the concept of a statutory employer. Both of them have the concept that that statutory employer is immune from common law or statutory actions. The only difference is that in Virginia they guarantee the money will be there by saying if you hire somebody to do the job, you have to go out and get insurance to make sure that comp benefit is there, where the Federal statute says you only have to go out and get that insurance if the person you've hired hasn't fulfilled his responsibility. And that's kind of an iffy thing, because he can show you a certificate of insurance and it turns out to be that there's no coverage for one reason or another. All I'm saying is that this is a very limited exception -- a very limited case -- where this man's descendants or his widow -- his mother -- will have no recovery, but it's not the ordinary case. And I don't think the law can change based upon the happenstance that we don't like the result for this particular plaintiff because in the next case you're going to be very happy with the results for the particular plaintiff."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "Well, I think it is, because you are then dealing with familial issues which the State has a strong interest in. Who should recover in the event of death? What should their relationship be to the decedent? What should be the degree of dependency, if any? These have always been left to the State."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Yes, but I wasn't asking you, the state law in Tungus was the liability as well as who picks it up. But now where -- you seem to be suggesting that if you had Federal law, you would also have to invent who the survivors are for purposes of wrongful death, and I'm suggesting that there is no reason why you couldn't pick that up from state law."

      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "I don't see that as consistent with uniformity but again, Your Honor, what I think the Court is doing is proposing to fashion a remedy to benefit an individual in very limited circumstances where the bottom line is that the state application of state law, consistent with this Court's majority concurring and dissenting opinions in American Dredging, has no impact on commerce. I think we're losing sight of the objective in order to fashion a remedy. I think that -- I would suggest that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Again, if you're going to talk about impact on commerce, there really can't be any difference between injury and death, so I think once you concede that the injury would be covered by Federal law, you can't make an argument about the Commerce Clause that wouldn't apply to both."

      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "I do not believe that everything this Court has developed in the way of substantive law for injury is necessarily something that is required for uniformity in the sense of the constitutional basis of it, but rather a symmetry. And that's just the way things developed, but let me point out in Pope & Talbot, my opponent points out that in that particular case, look, they refused to apply the state contributory rule because there was a Federal rule of comparative negligence. Why? That wasn't -- this Court didn't say that that was because of uniformity concerns; the Court did so saying, look, we have considered -- we've already created a body of law. In that existing body of law we created certain rights, and those rights now exist. And if a right exists by virtue of a Congressional action or by a decision of this Court, a state can't take it away. So that body of law is not representative as a whole of a need for uniformity in all aspects of law. I respectfully submit that what I'm offering this Court is a predictability, that we look as Professor Fore suggests to our national interests -- that we look as this Court suggested in American Dredging to the impairment of commerce or to the Kamen court where the Court of Appeals of New York looked to whether state law had extraterritorial effect, and if it didn't have that kind of effect, then there was no need for pre-emption. There was no uniformity concern."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "It just seems to me that the language in Moragne itself points in the direction of extending liability to negligence if it can be characterized as a violation of a maritime duty. But where our Court has never really spoken to the question is whether that kind of liability extends beyond the owners of the vessels to people who are land-based, and I think that's where there is more of a question, although it certainly wasn't raised here very clearly. If it were a vessel owner who was the defendant here, would you take the same position that you're taking today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRINI",
      "speech": "My position is if it's a vessel owner, I can perfectly understand adoption or creation of a cause of action for the sake of uniformity. I would point out to Your Honor that my opponent's main argument I view as saying this Court in Moragne talked of maritime duties. What is a maritime duty? If a man comes on a vessel and pulls a gun on another man, he's violated duties but not maritime duties. Negligence as an abstract concept is not a maritime duty. The maritime duty I submit has to do with the manner in which the vessel is operated, and this Court has never said anything to the contrary. I point out that Kermarec and Leathers, the two cases that are said to refer to negligence as a maritime duty or a breach of a maritime duty, they dealt with vessel liability. Or the East River case which is stated by my opponent to refer to products liability as a breach of a maritime duty. That was that the product there was the main propulsion unit for the vessel. We keep coming back to the same thing. So that you treat people the same no matter where they are on the sea."

I think you keep, I keep coming back to the concept of what is it that we're trying to achieve? And what we're trying to achieve is a uniform treatment of foreigners much like the diversity concept."

But the argument that it was mere happenstance that he died aboard the ship I think ignores the very reason he was aboard the ship. It wasn't as in Kermarec. Kermarec, they had a social visitor aboard the ship. Mr. Ferrini acknowledges that's maritime in nature. It's hard to imagine a more maritime activity than what Mr. Garris himself was engaged in."

So that in that case I would disagree. I would think that Kermarec can be read and should be read as a vindication of maritime uniformity principles in almost all respects.

Why couldn't one say, even if it made no sense, this distinction between surviving injury and death?

I know, the Tungus would say you apply everything at whole, but on remand in the Yamaha case, the third circuit said we're not going to --I don't think they overruled the Tungus, but they suggested another course of activity was to apply the Federal liability standards, and that same course was filed in the Amtrak --"

I take it what you're telling us is that Mr. Ferrini was right when he said if you prevail, that there is a Federal maritime law claim for wrongful death, then there is no longer the claim that this Court thought was a viable one in Yamaha, that is, a wholly State-based wrongful death claim."

      "speech": "So you want to give them both, in other words. What do you think about Mr. Ferrini's argument, as I understand it, going back to the question that you were discussing with the Chief Justice? His point I think, if I understood it, is that look, I agree -- imagining he's making this argument -- I agree with you if a seaman is involved, you need a uniform admiralty law. If the seaworthiness of the vessel is involved, you need a uniform admiralty law. If a sea owner is involved, you need a uniform admiralty law. But in the absence of those things, the word uniformity has no reason. And, moreover, here we're talking about a local person in a harbor, local circumstances, and so local law should prevail. And when you come back and say, well, isn't that equally true of injury, he says yes. But even if we've decided the opposite in respect to injury, let's not make matters worse. And here he would say -- I guess, or I thought I heard him say -- that this particular wrongful death statute is more local yet, because it is not the injured person's personal statute. It belongs to the survivors. They're the ones who are suing, and they are local people, and that's unlike a personal injury action. And, indeed, you in fact have to pick up State law anyway, I've heard, in order to find out who those survivors are who are going to be able to sue. So he says this is even more local than the injury action and, besides, don't make matters worse. Now, I'm trying to paraphrase; I don't know if I've got it right, but if -- I'm trying to make it as strong as I can in my mind. Now I want to hear your response."

    {
      "speaker": "DONNELL",

We are not arguing here preemption."

To be specific, I would worry if in addition to all of Mr. Ferrini's arguments, my deciding you are right in this case means I've wiped out all the wrongful death actions belonging to States that somebody who was injured on a ship might otherwise have.

What you've done by creating the Moragne cause of action is you've gotten rid of that problem that the lower courts had to deal with in which they were trying to determine what aspects of State law they could apply, and which were violative of Federal maritime principles. I think you've actually cleaned up a problem as opposed to creating a new one.

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "So there is, then, a Federal act which basically ultimately is the reason for there being no liability here. There is a Virginia State bar, but the Virginia State bar depends upon payment of premiums by the subsidiary corporation under the Longshore Harbor Workers' Compensation Act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONNELL",
      "speech": "No. The Virginia act has no -- has no corresponding limit that limits it because you paid the benefits."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Well, I'll think about it. I still think ultimately -- I'm trying to help you. I think that ultimately there's -- it's, ultimately it's the existence of the Longshore Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and the benefits payments that were made by the subsidiary, that invokes the bar, or am I wrong about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONNELL",
      "speech": "That would not -- that's -- I believe that's irrelevant to the application of the state bar. It's only relevant to the application of the Longshoremen Harbor Worker Act Bar. In other words, if you -- if you actually pay the benefits under the Longshoremen bar, you receive the immunity. Under the state there's no similar limitation."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "You may be having trouble because I'm wrong, but I -- I don't know -- I don't know what it is that the subsidiary employer did that it operated to allow the parent to invoke the state bar, if it were not payment of Longshore Harbor Workers' Compensation benefits."

      "speaker": "DONNELL",
      "speech": "What I'm -- what I'm -- what I'm saying is that the payment -- let's assume there was no payments made to anyone. Norshipco would still have in the State wrongful death action -- they fall under the definition of statutory employer and would therefore be able to claim that defense. The fact that they were paid under the Federal statute doesn't affect that defense in State law, in the state wrongful death action."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Would you go back to Robins. You pointed out in your argument a second ago that the Court in Robins had made the remark that negligence in the course of this kind of repair work is not a matter of purely local concern, that it was properly maritime. Has there been any litigation -- and sorry, and what I further assume to be the case is that the cause of action that Robins recognized if it were to have a counterpart, it had a parallel in state law because Robins didn't say it was a purely maritime issue. And so Robins, as I understand it, left State law wherever it might be, and I presume there would have been a State law negligence action as well. Two questions: Am I right in that assumption that there was a State law negligence action parallel to what we recognized in Robins? And if the answer is yes, can you tell me whether there has been any litigation in the ensuing sixty years, I guess, on the issue of whether the state law action may continue to be recognized in the light of the fact that there is also a Federal cause of action?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONNELL",
      "speech": "Well, it's -- I would concede it's a confusing area. I don't know if there is any case that -- first of all, with regard to Robins, I don't read Robins as preempting State wrongful death statutes generally. There is language in there about where State law contradicts some fundamental feature of admiralty law, and so there is some of that. But I don't think the court went on -- the court concluded the Federal maritime law cause of action was to be the action because Federal maritime jurisdiction existed."

      "speech": "Yes, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "Okay. So they said we recognize the federal maritime claim. Now, is it clear that there was a parallel State law claim, and there was some kind of a State law claim for negligence which could also have been brought on the same facts. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONNELL",
      "speech": "Yes, and that's why the court discussed the difference between the two laws."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

So there's an implicit assumption in Yamaha that it did."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
