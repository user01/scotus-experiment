      "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is a single element in this case that properly determines its outcome, and that is that the product liability loss, as the district court said, and you can find this on page 36A of Appendix B. The product liability loss is a subset of the net operating loss. Section 172(a) and 172(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a net operating loss can be carried back three years. Section 172(b)(1)(I), and you can find the exact language on page two of petitioner's brief, provides that in the case of a taxpayer which has a product liability loss, the product liability loss shall be a net operating loss carry-back to each of the ten taxable years preceding the loss year. In Section 172(j)(1) then defines the term product liability loss, and that is, it is the lesser of the net operating loss for the year, and that is the net operating loss that can otherwise be carried back three years, or the sum of the amounts allowable as product liability deductions. So it is clear that the product liability loss is nothing other than a piece of the net operating loss. And if you apply that rule to a single stand-alone corporation, the first thing you do is determine whether the corporation has a net operating loss. If it has a net operating loss, the next thing you do is determine the extent to which that net operating loss is attributable to product liability deductions. And the product liability deductions in an amount not exceeding the net operating loss then becomes the product liability loss. That can be carried back ten years, but it's all part of the net operating loss. So if you have a product liability loss that's less than the entire net operating loss, then after you carry back the product liability loss ten years, what is left of the net operating loss can be carried back three years. The important part --"

And in order to provide a longer period of income against which potentially large losses might be deducted, the Congress thought it was appropriate to extend the statute and allow going back as far as ten years. I think the theory was that it would be logical that the income might arise years earlier than the three- year period, and Congress was simply extending the carry- back period to allow for that problem."

Did the -- did the successful companies in this affiliated group which, in fact, as I understand it, had the expenses involved here -- did they deduct the product liability expenses in the course of calculating what in effect turned out to be positive income which was then attributed to the group? Had they already -- leaving aside the treatment -- the possible treatment of the loss, has there already been a deduction taken by the constituent companies here?"

It's just -- it's hanging out there until you can carry that negative number to some other year and take a deduction against income in that other year. Then the deduction produces a tax benefit, so we have --"

The fact is that the very same product liability deductions that have been, quote, deducted, in arriving at separate taxable income are in the net operating loss that Respondent will agree we can carry back three years. And if we can carry it back three years and take a deduction, there's no double deduction. They would not claim that. They now want to say that because we're going back ten years, there's a double deduction, but that's simply not the case because we're reducing what we can otherwise take back three years."

But there's one feature of your case that's different from the Intermet case -- the other side of this split -- and that in Intermet, the corporation had sustained the loss that Lynchburg was also a member of the consolidated group in the carry-back year. But as I understand the facts of your case, you -- the deductions of the losses sustained in '83 to '86, and you want to carry it back to '73? Years when the corporations had sustained the loss were not part of the affiliated group. Why should it be carried back -- why should the affiliated group get this benefit when the companies who sustained the loss were not part of it in those carry-back years?"

In this case there -- the corporations that generated -- the members of the group that generated the product liability deductions would not have an allocated net operating loss under that provision of the regulations which is -79. And so there is no mechanism for carrying back to any separate return year. The only carry-back can be within the group. Now, if you have a corporation that joins a group and has deductions, even though it just joined the group, any deductions it has are going to find its way into the net operating loss that can be carried back. So the question again is the fact that the corporation would have deductions, even though it had separate taxable income. The fact that it is contributing to the net operating loss, even though it wasn't a member, say, the last year, does not prevent its deductions from being carried back three years as part of the net operating loss. And so in this case, it's merely a fact that they're going to be carried back ten years instead of three years."

And what this statute normally says is wait -- Company A, if you have some product liability loss, there are a lot of things that can cause losses, and you have all of them. It was a terrible company. But we're going to pretend that the two dollars there is product liability loss. That's called, let's pretend that's what the statute says -- as long as there was two dollars of it. We're not going to call it some other loss. Now, what you want to do is if Company A is part of, let's say, fifteen other companies, you want to pretend that the big losses run by these other companies which had nothing to do with product liability are product liability losses, too."

Now we buy them up, and now our let's pretend game allows us to count as our losses which came from totally other things -- having a very bad product, for example -- now are product liability losses, so we get to go back ten years.

Number two is that the result that you have just posited is not something that flows from the consolidated return regulations, but it is a result that can exist if a single stand-alone corporation were to find itself in the same position, it could go out, buy another corporation if the facts fit perfectly, liquidate it, and do exactly the same thing."

The reason for that is, as I said earlier, the net -- the product liability loss is just a piece of the net operating loss, and an affiliated group filing a consolidated return has only one net operating loss -- the consolidated operating loss. That's the only thing that exists to be carried back three years. Now, just as you would in the case of the separate corporation, you say, to what extent is that consolidated net operating loss the only thing that they had prescribed that can be carried back three years? To what extent is it attributable to product liability deductions? And you can determine that by looking at all of the product liability deductions of the group. It's right in there and every one of those deductions, regardless of whether the contributing member has negative taxable income or positive taxable income, goes right to that bottom line, and you can prove, dollar for dollar, that the net operating loss is attributable to every one of those deductions. And that, because of the way they have designed the regulations, they have provided only for the single consolidated net operating loss. That is what could be carried back three years, that's what a piece of can be carried back ten years. And there's no getting around that fact. And you don't need a regulation to say, let's do it on a consolidated basis. You really don't have to worry about whether we should view, in this particular case, the consolidated group as a single entity or as a group of separate companies."

      "speech": "I'm a little confused as to what position the Government is taking in this case, but in the court of appeals they basically argued that the net operating loss you should look at was the negative or positive separate taxable income of a company. That if you had positive taxable income, then the member didn't have a net operating loss and that was the end of the matter. The Fourth Circuit rejected that argument. The Fourth Circuit said, as the Petitioner argued, that the definition of separate taxable income is not the same as the definition of a net operating loss because separate taxable income excludes things like charitable contributions, capital gains and the like. And so negative taxable income can never equate theoretically, and definitionally, with a net operating loss. And so the Fourth Circuit went and found a net operating loss some place else."

      "speech": "If you lose, do we create any anomaly, or is there some -- what I'm thinking of is that you have -- the Government has, it seems to me, going for it the fact the language is pretty ambiguous. The language does list some things that should be consolidated, makes no mention of this. And there's at least one anomaly that's created if they lose. All right, you have going for you that the statute could be read your way, you could want to play the let's pretend game with the whole set, but is there anything else you have going for you in terms of policy that you want to bring up, or in terms of anomalies that would be created if you lost?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "speech": "Well, I think from a policy standpoint if you go back and look at the 1918 legislative history, that certainly when Congress brought the consolidated return into being, they thought of the affiliated group as one single business. The Respondent wants to treat every corporation as a separate business. Well, that's clearly contrary to what Congress thought. And it may be that you have situations where you can have an affiliated group with corporations in what we would call different lines of business, but that's not what Congress was talking about. They thought that all of the activity -- business activity under common ownership, was a single business. But even then you could have an affiliated group of five thousand coffee shops, or five thousand vitamin stores, all managed by a separate headquarters business -- all financed out of one separate headquarters business. I think it's pretty hard there to view each separately incorporated coffee shop as a business that's separate and apart from every other business. And in that case, it would make perfectly sense -- perfect sense if one member of the group had a product liability loss, even though it might otherwise be profitable, that this entire group which is all in the identical line of business should be able to avail itself of that."

Going back to your response to Justice Kennedy about the purpose of the provision -- what about the fact that if you do have separate corporations in different lines of business and one of them is profitable notwithstanding its history of product liability losses ten years ago, hasn't that served the purpose of allowing that business entity to recover the loss that has to be otherwise carried back ten years?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "speech": "If that corporation were a stand- alone corporation, I would say yes it is. But I think when you're dealing with an affiliated group, that puts too much emphasis on where you place the particular business. I mean, a good tax planner, if they thought this was a problem, could get around that by simply moving loss companies around. And if you take a loss company and put it where you're going to have the product liability deductions, you probably could straighten that problem out."

In that case, you always will end up with a profitable company acquired between the three and the ten years. You will always have the anomaly. That company will have taken, as a deduction from its income, its product liability loss, and its taxes will have been reduced accordingly, right? And then -- and then the consolidated company will be able to go back ten years and use some of its deductions once again, in that one situation where you have the acquisition of a profitable country -- company between three and ten years."

    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "speech": "It is theoretically possible, but I would say that if that highly unlikely scenario -- I mean, you might have to face up to the possibility of going out and buying a tobacco company and you think, well, it'll throw off some product liability deductions, but you have no idea the extent of that. You're kind of risking your entire company on some tax dodge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "speech": "But Mr. Fox, isn't that the point of the Government's -- the note it makes on page 41? The footnote in which it says there's no logical reason why Petitioner should be able to use these deductions to create product liability losses for itself simply because the affiliated corporations that actually incurred the product liability expenses realized profits instead of losses. The anomaly that -- as you said, the regulation doesn't cover the profit for a corporation, but it would cover one where there had been losses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "speech": "Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, that that is not really a function of consolidated returns. Take a single stand-alone corporation that has an oil business and a computer business. Now, they might have a product liability in the oil business, but when they report their income, they are reporting the entire company's income and losses. And if there is a profit in the oil business with a product liability deduction and a huge loss in the computer business, they put that all together and, even though the oil business was profitable and the product liability was more than offset by the oil company's income, because they are in a separate corporation, they can put everything together and they're going to get the product liability deduction. So the fact that you have disparate lines of business is not the thing that causes the problem, because you can get exactly the same result when you're dealing with a stand-alone corporation. And if that's not a problem there, I don't really see why it should be a problem in the affiliated group context."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "speech": "Yes, I think that is exactly the case. That's the way Congress viewed an affiliated group if you look at that 1918 legislative history. They say exactly that at some length. And I think, furthermore, that my ultimate point here is that the plain language of this statute requires that you look at the consolidated net operating loss -- that's the only thing we have that's a net operating loss, and you ask, to what extent is that net operating loss attributable to product liability deductions. We have in the general explanation of the Revenue Bill of 1978 which is cited on page 4 and 21 of our brief. This provision was explained this way. Under the Act, the amount of a net operating loss that is attributable to a product liability loss can be carried back an additional seven years is only one net operating loss this affiliated this group has, the consolidated net operating loss. And it seems to me that the plain language of the statute requires you to ask only one question: to what extent is that net operating loss attributable to product liability deductions? And that's the end of the matter. You don't need any special regulation. To the extent you're a little worried about this hypothetical, number one, the Government can correct that by regulations. They already have a provision in the Code, Section 269, that allows them to set aside deductions in the case of acquisitions made for tax avoidance. So I don't believe that we should let that little tail, if you will, wag this dog. That's a very small point, purely hypothetical, it can be dealt with by regulations. It can be dealt with by Section 269. If there are no other questions, I would appreciate reserving my time for rebuttal."

I don't want to avoid your question, but I think a little bit of background would be helpful. To answer that question, you have to understand what is the background principle that applies in consolidated returns. Since the Woolford Realty case, the background principle has clearly been that notwithstanding the consolidation, you treat each of the corporations as a separate tax-paying entity except as the regulations provide for consolidated treatment. So then you have to go to the regulations to see how the regulations provide for the consolidated treatment. Section 12 of the reg says that in determining consolidated income, the first step is to determine the separate income of each corporation based upon the rules that apply to the determination of taxes for separate tax-paying entities. Under that regulation, it's undisputed that the product liability expenses of each of these corporations are deducted from the income of each of these corporations, and --"

The first is a simple practical one. They don't contend that under any definition of separate net operating loss they would have had a loss. Each of these companies was profitable. They're claiming the rights of a hypothetical taxpayer that, in fact, in the twenty- three year history of this provision has never existed. There has never been a taxpayer with product liability expenses who had a positive separate taxable income but a negative separate net operating loss. That has just never happened. And that's why, in the twenty-three years, there's never been any reason for the Secretary to adopt a discrete regulation designed to address these minor differences because they have never been a practical issue.

One is, going into this whole picture with this company, there was an agent -- and I assume that this large amount of money had to go up higher in the Service who said, yeah, they're right, under the consolidated regs that now exist, they get this refund.

We would have to make some adjustments there, too. What the Secretary instead has done is he has a workable rule. It has the background rule that determines taxes at each individual affiliate. Because none of these affiliates have losses -- none of them have product liability losses to pass on to the consolidated level. Petitioner's theory would just recharacterize what is a normal loss for its other companies into some kind of special product liability loss. Now, I would like to emphasize because it is very important to us that Petitioner's theory in this case would lead to serious opportunities for manipulation and abuse.

It is not fair, and it's not what Congress provided, to let some other company that had no product liability expenses go back and get their taxes back from ten years. That's not what 172 is about. That's not what the consolidated tax return provisions are about. That's not what this Court or Congress intended to sanction. This Court said in Woolford Realty that this sort of juggling is not to happen, and in Section 1502, Congress said that the privilege of filing a consolidated return is not to be used as a license for evading taxes. That's what we have at issue here. I would like to point out that in Intermet, the Sixth Circuit got this issue wrong principally by relying on Section 80 of the regulations which the Court said creates a default rule under which you are supposed to apply tax provisions first at the consolidated level, unless a regulation otherwise provides. That's a hundred and eighty degrees off."

      "speech": "H Enterprises is a good example. We cited this in our brief. H Enterprises involved a company -- two affiliates, one of which bought some stock and the other, which borrowed some money and transferred it to its affiliate. And the affiliate used that money to buy the stock. Now, there's a limitation on the amount of interest that can be deducted for this kind of equity acquisition, and the question was, well, do you combine these two, or do you look at their separate character? And the answer of the tax court in H Enterprises was, no, you have to look at them as separate individuals and apply that provision separately first. Now, another -- and so the result was that, well, you didn't hold the interest -- the company that borrowed the money subject to this limitation of using that, that when the other company used the money to buy stock. The other example is -- is the First Chicago bank case which we've cited where the question is, well, can a company claim a dividends-received deduction? It can only do that if it holds a certain percentage of the stock of the company. One affiliate owned less than that amount, and another affiliate owned less than that amount, but when you combine them, they both own more than that amount. But because you local -- you focus your inquiry first on each separate company, neither of those companies qualified for the dividends-received deduction because neither of them individually met the requirement. When Congress has wanted to provide for consolidated treatment of loss items, they've done so expressly. In 172(h), Congress provides a loss limitation on certain kinds of interest incurred in connection with equity acquisitions and expressly stated that when this provision applies to a corporation that is a member of an affiliated group, it is to be applied to the affiliated group directly. Congress made no such consolidation -- required no such consolidated treatment for product liability losses that are described only a few paragraphs away. The implication of this seems to be pretty clear -- that Congress recognizes the background rule that this Court described in Woolford Realty, which is, you look at each of these companies as individual entities first, unless a regulation provides separately. That's why I was focusing on how the regulations tell us what to do. The regulations tell us take these deductions at the individual affiliate level first. Having taken them at the individual affiliate level -- these were profitable affiliates, they had no losses to pass on to the consolidated return. The losses at the consolidated level are ordinary losses with a three-year carry-back, not this special ten-year carry-back that you can only get through juggling of tax attributes as this Court described in Woolford Realty. I want to just briefly touch on one thing that was raised in the reply brief, which is a new argument and which is wrong. In the reply brief they say that the Gottesman case stands for the concept that you construe all ambiguities in consolidated return regulations against the Secretary. Looking at that case, it's clearly not what it holds. What it says is that penalty provisions are narrowly interpreted. Penalty provisions are to be construed against the Secretary. The ordinary rule that this Court established in White v. United States in 305 U.S., which we always cite when taxpayers make this argument, is that there is no policy of lenity. That the tax provisions are not interpreted in favor of the taxpayer. Indeed, in a case like this involving deductions which are a matter of legislative grace, any ambiguity is to be resolved against the taxpayer. This taxpayer has not satisfied the requirement of showing that its profitable affiliates had losses from product liability. Congress did not intend to provide benefits for any other type of corporation, and the consolidated return regulations don't get them there, either. I think I've covered what I intended to."

      "speech": "The Respondent takes the position that if the regulations do not address a particular provision, that any provision in the Code has to be applied on a separate company basis and not on a consolidated basis. That is totally inconsistent with the position that the Internal Revenue Service took in both Gottesman and H Enterprises. In the Gottesman case, the IRS argued that the accumulated earnings tax had to be applied on a single- entity basis. They happened to lose that case, but that was their position. In H Enterprises, they took the position that the disallowance of interest rule had to be applied on a consolidated basis, and they won the case. What happened in that case was the taxpayer argued that they had borrowing in one company, and the tax exempt bonds in another company, and that you shouldn't look at the two together. But H Enterprises is -- clearly provides that you look at the whole thing as one, and there was no regulation that said that. The other point I want to make is that the Government seems to think that you can kind of have a -- it's not very important as to how close the definition of separate taxable income may come to net operating loss. I think that is, in a sense, totally irrelevant because the statute says, you look at the net operating loss. The regulations have provided for a net operating loss. It's the consolidated net operating loss. I see no reason why it would even look at separate taxable income. The question is, we have the regulations provision for the separate net operating loss, and the issue is, to what degree does that net operating loss that everyone agrees can be carried back three years -- to what extent is it attributable to product liability deductions? When we come up with the number, that's the product liability loss. And that's the end of the matter, and you don't need a regulation to tell you to get there, because the statute is clear on its face, and the Service has put in the regulation the definition of net operating loss. Thank you."
