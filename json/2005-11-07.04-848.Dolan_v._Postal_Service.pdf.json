The Petitioner's construction shields the Government from all claims arising out of loss or damage or delay or destruction of the mail, while allowing claims that do not stem from all -- do not stem from the violation of the unique duty of the Postal Service to make sure that the mail arrives on time and in good condition. It is the construction most faithful with the text and purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The exception bars any claims, whether for personal injury or property damage, that arise while the mail is -- if the mail is lost, misdelivered, damaged, or delayed. The Government argues for a much broader construction that would bar all claims that arise from the handling of mail.

So, they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery claims, all that pack -- family of things, everybody'll say, \"Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check.\" I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up.

I can try a person-to-person delivery.

If you set this same package down, and it has medicine or food in it -- it says -- marked \"perishable\" on the outside -- it's in the sun, it goes rotten, the person gets sick, there's no liability. But the -- this is a protection for an activity of the Government, like the -- many of the other Federal Tort Claim Act exceptions.

But, again, I think it's very important to keep in mind here that we do have -- we have text -- this is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and that this falls within the text. There are two ways of looking at it. Their way does not capture important things to the Postal Service. It doesn't seem to capture what is admitted into the mails, and it doesn't seem to capture the important decisions that are made -- it may not seem so important, in this one case, to have put the mail on the porch, but multiply it by tens of millions of times a day when that decision is made, and the decision that that balance, of putting things there in a sheltered way, hopefully that will both protect the mail and the people, instead of either reverting to person-to-person delivery for all oversized mail or making people come down, like the old days, to the Post Office to pick it up.

And the Postal -- the Post Office's own handbook dealing with the handling of negligence cases sets forth procedures and policies that deal exactly with this type of circumstance. If we were to look at the handbook -- I think, Justice Kennedy referred to the handbook, and that section 141 of the Postal Investigation Handbook talks about claims that arise for personal injury or property damage during the delivery of the mail. So, at least since -- and that's been -- that was put in place in 1992, so we at least know, for the last 13 years, that they've anticipated these type of claims. And, according to the Government, there's only been ten a year. So, I don't think that there's a real concern by the Post Office that there's going to be some -- a floodgate of litigation opened up."
