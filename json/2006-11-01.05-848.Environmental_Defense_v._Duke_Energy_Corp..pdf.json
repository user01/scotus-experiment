      "speech": "Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Clean Air Act requires that the owner of a major emitting facility obtain a prevention of significant deterioration permit before engaging in a modification, which is defined to include any physical change that increases the amount of any pollutant emitted by such source. Since 1980, EPA's PSD regulations have measured such increases in terms of actual emissions in tons per year."

      "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, as we point out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt Duke's theory, in fact contradicts it. He doesn't say that a new source performance standard modification must precede a PSD major modification. Instead, in both he relies on the express exclusion in the PSD regulations for increases in hours of operation and the production rate, and as EPA explained in its contemporaneous preamble, that provision by its terms is an exception from the definition of physical change. It is not a provision that says -- increase is attributable to a physical change, to increased hours that are enabled by physical change, are not considered. The plain language of the regulation actually contradicts this reading. These determinations themselves are quite ambiguous, and of course they are two of dozens of such determinations."

      "speaker": "DONAHUE",

They don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor. And then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar."

As Judge Posner in the Cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a challenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations because they don't say it, they don't provide for it, and they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn on actual annual emissions. And the entire rationale EPA offered was linked to that effort to capture real world changes in emissions."

What it can't do is certainly what the Fourth Circuit did, which is to say that the PSD regulations must be the same. They are obviously not the same. They are different in multiple respects. And certainly that challenge could have been raised, and certainly that challenge was barred, and of course the court of appeals expressly called the regulations irrelevant, the texts and interpretations of the regulations. That's exactly what a court is supposed to be doing."

In deciding whether the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper for a court to take into account that the regulations must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD definition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS definition? I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory - - or regulatory construction. Cannot a court give great weight to that in interpreting these ambiguous regulations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONAHUE",
      "speech": "Well, that -- they're not ambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold that they have to be is certainly an invalidation. And the D.C. Circuit, of course, held that the statute doesn't require identity as between the two sets of regulations. And we're not here on certiorari from the New York decision, we're here on an enforcement action in which a court leapt over the express limitations imposed on it, declared the language of the regulations irrelevant, and indeed misapplied them rather dramatically."

Circuit said there's no statutory mandate of identity and that the -- and, of course, Respondent was there in the D.C. Circuit. It was permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence, as the court called it, between NSPS regulations and PSD. And the court said - -"

    {
      "speaker": "DONAHUE",
      "speech": "Certainly. I mean, WEPCO was an applicability determination. That was in 1989-90. Puerto Rican Cement was an applicability determination. Duke instead, knowing that EPA believed that increased utilization that is caused by physical change has to be considered under this, as is prescribed in these very detailed regulations, Duke decided not to do that, to go forward, and it didn't, in fact, come to the State or to EPA. Of course, the increased hours -- I understand the Court's concern about the Reich memos. But EPA's construction of the increased hours exception is completely correct under the plain language of the regulations. And in WEPCO the Court upheld. So that there was no question that not only was it consistent with the plain language, but whatever Reich had said, the express language of the regulations was as far as the exception went. There was no further confusion, if those early memos caused confusion. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. Thank you."

It's true that there are those ambiguous and cursory 1981 statements from Mr. Reich, who was a subordinate official within EPA. In 1988, the administrator of EPA, the head of the agency, in the WEPCO decision, the applicability determination, made very clear what EPA's position is on the application of the hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this is an annual tons per year test. That's page 44 of the joint appendix. He made that perfectly clear and it has always been clear that that is, in fact, the EPA's official position beginning with the 1980 preamble. But again - -"

In 2003, Duke and other parties sought to reopen and were granted permission to reopen that challenge to the 1980 rules. They filed a statement of issues in 1984 and a brief in 1984 challenging the regulation on the ground that if EPA's interpretation was correct and that it did not require an increase in maximum total achievable emissions, as the NSPS did, test did, they argued that it was invalid. They raised the very incorporation theory that they advance here, that is the statutory argument that Congress was required to follow for the PSD regulations the same regulatory approach that the NSPS regulations had followed in 1977 with the hourly maximum achievable test. They made that very argument in their brief in the D.C. Circuit in 2004, the D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument on the merits."

      "speaker": "JUSTICE ROBERTS",

      "speaker": "HUNGAR",
      "speech": "Yes. Well, I think it's important to distinguish. There are two statutory arguments here. One is what I would call the incorporation theory. That is the argument that Congress by borrowing the definition, the statutory definition, also necessarily borrowed and mandated adoption of the regulatory definition from the NSPS program. That argument, the incorporation argument, was made by Duke in its brief in 2004 in the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument at pages 17 through 19 of its decision in its 2005 New York decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUSTICE SCALIA",
      "speech": "Why was that rejection wrong? Because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction. Is it conceivable that when Congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else. I mean, to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing."

The agency must choose from among the options that are permissible given the range of language that Congress used. But within that range the agency has discretion. Think of it this way, Your Honor. If there were no PSD program, if we were talking only about the NSPS program, Congress gave an ambiguous definition to the agency the agency would have discretion to adopt different tests for determining whether emissions increased for different types of equipment even within that single program, because the statutory definition is ambiguous. The statute therefore does not mandate a one size fits all approach and the agency in its discretion could well determine that one emissions test is appropriate for some types of equipment, another emissions test is appropriate for other types of equipment, as long as both of those tests are within the permissible bounds of the statutory ambiguity. The agency is entitled to do that."

It's quite common, Your Honor, in any regime where review of an agency decision is relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of one court, as it is here, and enforcement proceedings are brought in a different court. Hobbs Act agencies, their decisions are reviewable in the court of appeals but often enforceable in the district courts. The district court cannot look behind the determination of the agency to challenge its validity because that rests in the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals. Obviously there's a timing issue in this statute as well because of the requirement of pre-enforcement review. Whatever -- whatever concerns might be raised in a situation where a party could not reasonably have been expected to challenge it at the time it was originally promulgated are addressed by the after-arising provision in section 307(b)(1) which permits challenges that could not have been made within the 60-day period to be brought later in appropriate circumstances. And in any event, if there were some concerns at the outer limits of a provision like this one, they have nothing to do with this case where Duke's challenge, actual challenge to the agency decision, the 1980 rule, it was heard in 2005. And so Duke had more opportunity than you could possibly ask for to understand exactly what EPA's position was, understand exactly what the regulation meant and to challenge it in the D.C. Circuit.

You set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is \"any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase.\" Then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate. So that's out of it. Now, the question is what's in it? If that's out of it, what's in it? I think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours. And they say their proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation for years and years and years. Indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it. And then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more. It's just you run it more hours. Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about. And they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend. All right. Now, that's what I think, that's what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the heart of it. And if it is, what do you say?"

It is undisputed that Duke made physical changes to its facilities, major modifications, sort of using that term in the non-regulatory sense, but substantial replacements of physical equipment at the facilities. So physical change has occurred. The hours of operation exclusion, therefore, has no longer any relevance because it applies only at the physical change step of the analysis. There has been a physical change here regardless of whether hours of operation changed or not. Therefore, the hours of operation exclusion no longer applies. The next question is whether the -- if the physical change that did occur resulted in a significant net emissions increase. Here it did under the plain language of the regulations and under the test that EPA applies. It is true that 1981 they were arguably mistaken to the extent one can discern what the, Mr. Reich was actually saying, they seem to be simply a mistake in interpretation. But in 1988, the administrator of the agency, the head of the agency, made very clear EPA's position, the very same position it is taking here today on the hours of operation exclusion. The First Circuit in the Puerto Rican Cement case, as Your Honor knows, upheld that interpretation in 1989. The Seventh Circuit in footnote 11 in the WEPCO decision upheld that determination in 1990. It was restated by the EPA again and again and it is well established. Thank you, Your Honor."

So it didn't say anything about the argument we've been making which is what is a modification. The only statements that I know of that are out there are the two Reich statements which I just quoted to you, says exactly our interpretation. But even more powerful at least in my view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the State of Alabama and the 12 States that relied on the Region 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that amicus brief and the answer, the question is -- you know -- how do you determine what is a modification? You know does something that doesn't increase the hours, the emissions per hour, constitute it? It says no. Since the modification does not cause any increase in the hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual emissions should be calculated. They could not have said that any more clearly than - -"

The answer given on the other side at this point, that we should have -- we should have sought a determination.

It makes much more sense to recognize that modification is the trigger for construction which is in part 51(2) and that that incorporates this entire modification language."

This is (b)(8), construction means a modification, okay, of an emissions unit. So that -- and modification, if it is undefined in title 51, right? According to 15.100, means whatever it means under the statute. So that just takes you back to the statute. And this is the interpretation under the statute. The 52 interpretation is also an interpretation under the statute. So it is completely circular and brings you right back to the same definition. I agree by its terms it doesn't apply to 51. But going through the definitional provision in part 51 through the definition of the trigger for construction, which is modification, it takes you right back to the same meaning of the same provisions. So there is no difference between the two. And to me, it is really critical. And it seems to me there are sort of two points to make here. One is nobody on the Petitioner's side of this case answers the State -- the dozen States who say we relied upon you when we adopted these SIPs. We realized that you are asking us to take on enormous burdens. And you should have told us that before we went down this path in the first place."

It should have -- it should have deleted 52.01. And it should have adopted the proposed regulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs. This is on page 9 of their brief. This statement is astonishing to me. \"The term major modification serves as the definition of modification or modified when used in the act in reference to a major stationary source.\" If they had adopted that regulation in 1980, I wouldn't had to litigate this issue 25 years later.

And to put this in context, you'll remember, these regulations were adopted in the wake of the Alabama Power decision. Alabama Power didn't deal with the issue of modification. That wasn't before the court. Nobody had challenged modification's definition. The hourly emissions rate was a perfectly valid one. What the court in Alabama Power said is, you can't use this threshold for major modification. And then the case - - so then the matter comes back, and if EPA immediately adopts a new set of regulations that deal what, with what? Major modification, not with modification. And then they go through this entire elaborate analysis of major modification, none of which, candidly, do we challenge.

The only question I have -- I mean, I don't think that it necessarily has to be -- that every word has to be identical in the two provisions, but I do think they have to be congruent. And so, that's the strong version of our argument, and that's pretty close to where the Fourth Circuit was. The weaker version of our argument, which gets I think some mileage on the arbitrary and capricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if Congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in two statutes, and EPA then purports to be implementing that statute, it has some obligation to explain how it is that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term modification.

Nothing. Because in our view, the 1980 regulation quite clearly says what we want it to say. The only thing that's changed is that the preambles have interpreted the 1980. We challenged that and the D.C. Circuit said no, we're not going to address that issue. That's an issue when you get back up, when you get back on your enforcement action.

The only action of the administrator was the 1980 regulation, which we interpret as not changing modification. If you read 52.01(d), it clearly retains modification. We have no quarrel, then, with what the administrator did in 1980. Then they adopt preambles to the subsequent regs. We do challenge those, but the D.C. Circuit said we're not entitled to do that, that's got to wait for an enforcement action. The only thing that's left out there is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the administrator.

I would think at a minimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to jump on a expansive interpretation of 307(b) where it operates in a context like this as a pure gotcha. You adopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with, you change the regulation afterwards and then you come back and you say you can't challenge it at this point. That just cannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute. If there are no further questions, I would ask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit. Thank you."
